Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with h/o CAD s/p LAD POBA in 
___, DES to RCA in ___ and ___, HTN, HLD, presented for 
elective cardiac catheterization for unstable angina, found to 
have left main disease admitted for surgical revascularization. 
The patient was brought to  the operating room on ___ where 
the patient underwent CABGx4 (___-LAD, ___-OM,___-rPDA-rPLD 
sequence). Patient was only 3 days off plavix. Overall the 
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was 
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and 
invasive monitoring. He arrived on Neo with increased CT 
drainage for the firt few hours and received plts, protamine and 
2 units of cells. The bleeding resolved. He remained intubated 
overnight due to hemodynamic instability. He extubated the 
morning of POD#1. He was found to be  alert and oriented x 2 and 
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact 
but mildly confused.  He remained hypotensive, requiring volume 
and a-pacing. Over the next ___ hrs he became more confused he 
pulled out his central line and chest tubes without incident. He 
has a history of alcohol use and was placed on CIWA scale. He 
remained in the unit for several days due to his confusion. He 
eventully improved and was transferred to the floor.  Beta 
blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward 
the preoperative weight.  Pacing wires were discontinued without 
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy 
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  On post-op 
#7 he fell on the floor afterwards he complained of left 
shoulder pain, but a follow-up radiograph revealed no fracture.  
By the time of discharge on post-operative day eight the patient 
was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was 
controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to 
home in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.

certify I was present in compliance with ___ regulations. The 
___ was under general anesthesia throughout the procedure. 
No TEE related complications. Results were personally reviewed 
with the MD caring for the ___.  
Conclusions  
Pre-CPB:
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 

There are multiple complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending 
thoracic aorta, at least two of which have mobile components. No 
thoracic aortic dissection is seen. There are three aortic valve 
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. 
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). 
Moderate (2+) central aortic regurgitation is seen. 

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. 

___ was notified in person of the results at time of 
study.

Post-CPB:
The ___ is on a phenylephrine infusion. There is a 
bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. The valve appears 
well seated with normally mobile leaflets. There are no 
paravalvular leaks and no AI. The peak gradient across the 
aortic valve is 22mmHg, the mean gradient is 11mmHg with CO of 
4.1L/min.

The LV systolic function appears preserved. There is a period 
where inferior and inferoseptal hypokinesis is noted. This 
resolves by the end of the case. This is possibly due to air in 
the graft. The RV systolic function is unchanged. 

The MR remains trace. There is no evidence of aortic dissection. 
The mobile atheroma in the descending aortia appear unchanged.   

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where 
___ underwent an aortic valve replacement #21 ___ tissue 
valve, coronary artery bypass grafting times one (SVG to PDA).  
Overall the ___ tolerated the procedure well and 
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  
Post-operative one found the ___ extubated, alert and 
oriented and breathing comfortably.  The ___ was 
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned from 
inotropic and vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated 
and the ___ was gently diuresed toward the preoperative 
weight.  The ___ was transferred to the telemetry floor for 
further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were 
discontinued without complication.  The ___ was evaluated by 
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and 
mobility.  By the time of discharge on post-operative day four

well and was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for 
recovery and invasive monitoring. He was weaned from sedation, 
awoke neurologically intact, and was extubated on post-operative 
day one. He weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support. Beta 
blocker was initiated and he was diuresed toward his 
preoperative weight. Mr. ___ remained hemodynamically 
stable and was transferred to the telemetry floor for further 
recovery. Chest tubes and epicardial wires were removed per 
protocol. He was evaluated by the physical therapy service for 
assistance with strength and mobility. On the evening of 
post-operative day two he had about two hours of atrial 
fibrillation and therefore was placed on oral amiodarone. His 
beta blockade was up-titrated as tolerated. By the time of 
discharge on post-operative day four he was ambulating freely, 
his wounds were healing well, and his pain was controlled with 
oral analgesics. He was discharged to home in good condition 
with appropriate follow up instructions.

Imaging
___ CXR :
Small left pneumothorax has developed following removal of the 
basal and 
medial pleural tube.  There is no appreciable left pleural 
effusion, but there is a small region of consolidation in the 
left lower lobe, which could be area of focal bleeding.  Right 
basal atelectasis is new.  Heart size normal. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the thoracic surgery service for a 
left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.  He was taken to the OR and 
underwent an uncomplicated VATS LLL lobectomy with placement of 
a chest tube.  He tolerated the procedure without complications 
and recovered uneventfully in the PACU before being transferred 
to the floor in stable condition.  (Please see the associated 
operative report for specific procedural details.)  
Post-operatively his pain was controlled with a PCA and IV pain 
medication with a transition to PO pain meds once tolerating 
POs.  His diet was advanced slowly and without difficulty.  His 
chest tube was removed on POD#2 without incident and his oxygen 
saturations were > 95% on room air. He was able to use his 
incentive spirometer effectively.

Unfortunately he failed one voiding trial which required 
replacement of his Foley catheter for an additional day.  His 
second voiding trial was successful and Flomax was also started. 
 He had some confusion with the use of Dilaudid but improved 
with Ultram and Tylenol. 

Upon standing up for a chest xray he had some dizziness and 
orthostatic signs were checked.  Lying, his BP was 114/70 with a 
heart rate of 78 and standing it was 80/42 with a heart rate of 
88.  He was initially treated with IV fluids and increasing his 
oral intake of liquids.  Despite doing that his orthostasis 
persisted and an EKG demonstrated atrial fibrillation at a rate 
of 114. This was also associated with hypokalemia, 
hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia. After repleting his 
electrolytes and starting metoprolol, he converted back into 
sinus rhythm.

Of note, he had been on Lopressor as recent as ___ but 
after discussing the situation with his wife, she monitored him 
closely and noticed that his heart rate was in the 50's 
therefore stopped the lopressor.  There is no prior record of 
atrial fibrillation noted in his record.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:  

  
  
    
 
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic  
Conclusions  
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo 
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial 
appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in 
the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular 
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to 
distal moderate anterior and ___ wall hypoknesis. 
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis 
(LVEF = 35-40%). Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
mildly depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. with normal free wall 
contractility. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. 
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion.

POST CPB:

The EF looks slightly improved from prebypass. EF 40-45%. The

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the ___ on ___ via transfer 
from ___ for surgical management of his coronary 
artery disease. He was worked-up by the cardiac surgical service 
in the usual preoperative manner. He waited for Plavix washout, 
requiring Nitroglycerin drip for his stenosis preop. Bedside 
PFTs were done. He had an episode of Epistaxis on HD# 4. His 
hematocrit was=25 and he was transfused one pack red blood 
cells. His Hep drip was held at that time. 
On HD# 5 he was taken to the operating room and underwent 1. 
Urgent pump assisted coronary artery bypass graft x3: Left 
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, 
saphenous vein graft to diagonal and obtuse  marginal arteries.
2. Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous vein with 
___.  He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred 
to the CVICU for further invasive monitoring. He awoke 
neurologically intact and weaned to extubate. His postop 
hypertension was controlled with Nicardipine drip. He weaned off 
the drip with Hydralazine and Beta-blocker. Statin/ASA and 
diuresis were initiated. All lines and tubes were discontinued 
per protocol withoout incident. On pod#1 he transferred to the 
step down unit for further recovery. Physical Therapy was 
consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility. While on the 
step down unit his rhythm went into rapid atrial fibrillation. 
Initially the rate was difficult to control requiring Amio bolus 
x 2 and drip per protocol along with IV Beta-blocker and 
Diltiazem. Ultimately he converted into normal sinus rhythm. No 
anticoagulation per ___ he went back into AF. His 
home meds were reinstated as tolerated. The remainder of his 
hospital course was essentially unremarkable. He continued 
to progress and was cleared for discharge to home with ___ on 
pod#5. All follow up appointments were advised.
