Describe the progression of left-sided weakness for Tracy Thompson.,"Tracy Thompson's left-sided weakness appears to have progressed over time. Initially, she was noted to have left SCM weakness, mild L pronation with upward drift, and mild left deltoid weakness during a clinic visit. She also had brisk reflexes at left biceps and patella, and a mute plantar response bilaterally. Later on, she presented with acute onset left-sided weakness that started in her left leg and evolved to involve her left arm. Her exam on admission showed left SCM, deltoid, and triceps weakness, as well as mild weakness of her left IP and brisker reflexes on the left. Additionally, she had a prior history of left-sided weakness due to a paramedian pontine infarct and right-sided lenticulostriate territory infarct. This progression of left-sided weakness may be related to her underlying medical conditions, such as prior strokes and potential metastatic lesions.","[10003299-DS-10:12,10003299-DS-9:14,10003299-DS-6:0,10003299-DS-10:0,10003299-DS-6:12,10003299-DS-8:6,10003299-DS-7:3,10003299-DS-10:1,10003299-DS-7:16,10003299-DS-7:15]","The progression of left-sided weakness for Tracy Thompson appears to have started with acute onset left leg weakness that evolved to involve the left arm. She experienced left-sided weakness that improved without sensory changes or other neurological symptoms. On examination, she had weakness in her left SCM, deltoid, triceps, and mild weakness in her left IP, as well as brisk reflexes on the left side. The neurologic symptoms were thought to be a recrudescence of prior stroke symptoms in the setting of dehydration, deconditioning, and malnutrition. Additionally, she had a history of multiple strokes in the right posterior MCA/PCA watershed region and was noted to have no signs of neuropathy, intact sensation, and proprioception. The left-sided weakness progressed to involve the left arm and was associated with confusion and pneumonia concerns.","[10003299-DS-10:12,10003299-DS-9:14,10003299-DS-6:0,10003299-DS-10:0,10003299-DS-6:12,10003299-DS-8:6,10003299-DS-7:3,10003299-DS-10:1,10003299-DS-7:16,10003299-DS-7:15]","The progression of left-sided weakness for Tracy Thompson is described as subacute worsening of her chronic left-sided hemiparesis and confusion.

She also had brisk reflexes at left biceps and patella, with a mute plantar response bilaterally. She had a broad-based gait with small steps that was safe. 

During a hospital admission, Tracy presented with acute onset left-sided weakness, which improved without sensory changes or other neurological symptoms. Her exam on admission revealed left SCM, deltoid, and triceps weakness, as well as mild weakness of her left IP and brisker reflexes on the left. 

In a subsequent hospital admission, Tracy had progressively worsening left leg weakness and falls over a 4-week period. She had no signs of neuropathy, intact sensation, and intact proprioception. A CT head revealed a new hypodensity in the right frontal lobe, suggesting an acute and subacute infarct, which could explain her symptoms. 

Overall, Tracy's left-sided weakness has evolved from mild weakness in specific muscle groups to more generalized weakness and functional impairment over time, likely due to multiple infarcts and underlying risk factors.","[10003299-DS-7:2,10003299-DS-6:0,10003299-DS-6:13,10003299-DS-6:10,10003299-DS-6:12,10003299-DS-7:13,10003299-DS-4:11,10003299-DS-7:3,10003299-DS-7:16,10003299-DS-7:15]",1.0,0.5714285714285714,0.31428571428571433,0.19681583252066046,0.5,0.41025641025641024,0.20512820512820512,0.12041768501673998,1.0,0.8333333333333333,0.7575757575757576,0.678578676501298,0.0,0.30973451327433627,0.168141592920354,0.03692769633508002,0.0,0.3478260869565218,0.21256038647342998,0.031881604934689736,0.5,0.41255605381165916,0.2242152466367713,0.10202841766041118,0.5,0.4523809523809524,0.25396825396825395,0.1628470493723474,0.0,0.1686746987951807,0.12048192771084336,0.0073043384594067865,0.5,0.5196374622356495,0.32024169184290036,0.18152803337891388

"What are the most severe withdrawal symptoms experienced by patients with a history of drug or alcohol use, and how were withdrawal symptoms treated?","The most severe withdrawal symptoms experienced by patients with a history of drug or alcohol use include seizures and delirium tremens. In the clinical notes provided, there is mention of a patient named Henry Hill who did not have a history of withdrawal seizures but required phenobarbital during a prior admission. This suggests that he may have experienced withdrawal symptoms in the past that required medical intervention.

In terms of treatment for withdrawal symptoms, the notes mention that Henry Hill did not experience withdrawal on his current admission, possibly due to cutting down on his drinking. However, he was advised that even small amounts of alcohol can cause further damage to his liver, which is now more fragile due to cirrhosis. This indicates that the best treatment for withdrawal symptoms in patients with a history of drug or alcohol use is to abstain from substance use entirely to prevent further harm to their health.

Overall, the most severe withdrawal symptoms experienced by these patients are seizures and delirium tremens, and the best treatment is to avoid substance use altogether to prevent further complications.","[10000883-DS-4:3,10002528-DS-18:7,10005866-DS-16:1,10000935-DS-21:17,10002528-DS-18:5,10001667-DS-10:16,10002930-DS-11:0,10005606-DS-18:9,10003502-DS-7:1,10002976-DS-2:1]","The most severe withdrawal symptoms experienced by patients with a history of drug or alcohol use include seizures and delirium tremens.

In the case of Mary Leblanc, there is no mention of withdrawal symptoms, indicating that she may not have experienced severe withdrawal symptoms.

For Nadia Alger, there is no specific mention of withdrawal symptoms related to drug or alcohol use, but she is being referred to a psychiatrist for further titration of psychiatric medications, which may suggest that she has experienced withdrawal symptoms in the past.

In the case of April Barclay, there is no mention of withdrawal symptoms related to drug or alcohol use, but she is being advised to increase her apixaban dosage and start a Vitamin B12 supplement, which may indicate a need for medical management of potential withdrawal symptoms.

For Edward Fisher, there is no mention of withdrawal symptoms related to drug or alcohol use, but he does report feeling anxious and having occasional panic attacks, which may be related to withdrawal symptoms.
