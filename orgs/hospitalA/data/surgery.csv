Brief Hospital Course:
This ___ year old female was admitted to the hospital and was 
made NPO, IV fluids were started and she had a nasogastric tube 
placed.  She was pan cultured for a temperature of 101 and was 
followed with serial KUB's and physical exam. Her nasogastric 
tube was clamped on hospital day 2 and she soon developed 
increased abdominal pain prompting repeat CT of abdomen and 
pelvis.  This demonstrated an increase in the degree of 
obstruction and she was subsequently taken to the operating room 
for the aforementioned procedure.

She tolerated the procedure well, remained NPO  with nasogastric 
tube in place and treated with IV fluids.  Her pain was 
initially controlled with a morphine PCA .  Her nasogastric tube 
was removed on post op day #2 and she began a clear liquid diet 
which she tolerated well.  This was gradually advanced over 36 
hours to a regular diet and was tolerated well.  She was having 
bowel movements and tolerated oral pain medication.  Her 
incision was healing well and staples were intact.  After an 
uncomplicated course she was discharged home on ___

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
___ year old woman with h/o divertic s/p colectomy here with 
elevated WBC and nausea 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: RF

INDICATION: ___ woman with elevated white blood cell 
count and nausea, history of recent colectomy for recurrent 
diverticulitis.

COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis of ___.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images were obtained through the 
abdomen and pelvis after the administration of oral contrast. No 
intravenous contrast was administered. Multiplanar reformatted 
images were also obtained.

FINDINGS: 

The lung bases are clear. A 4-mm calcified granuloma in the 
right lung base is unchanged. Limited images of the heart are 
unremarkable. There is no pericardial effusion.

In the abdomen, the liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, adrenal 
glands, pancreas, stomach, and intra-abdominal loops of small 
and large bowel are unremarkable. There is no mesenteric 
lymphadenopathy. There is no free fluid or free air in the 
abdomen. Immediately adjacent to the left common iliac artery, 
is a linear focus of hyper-attenuating material, with the 
appearance of suture material, largely unchanged from the prior 
examination.

In the pelvis, suture material is seen in the distal sigmoid 
colon, unchanged in appearance from prior examination and 
consistent with colonic anastomosis. There is no evidence of 
stricture or obstruction at this site. There is no local fluid 
collection to indicate abscess. There are no signs of 
inflammation. The intrapelvic loops of small and large bowel are 
unremarkable, containing air and stool in a normal pattern 
without bowel dilatation. The appendix is visualized and is 
normal. The urinary bladder, uterus, and adnexa are 
unremarkable. There are no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes in 
the pelvis. A fat-containing left inguinal hernia is unchanged.

Examination of soft tissues reveals stranding and subcutaneous 
air of the soft tissues along the midline lower anterior 
abdominal wall, slightly larger in size than on the prior 
examination of approximately 2 weeks ago. Additionally, a small 
focus of fluid attenuating material now extends from the 
abdominal wall musculature through the subcutaneous tissues, and 
appears to drain into an external collecting device. No discrete 
fluid collection is identified to indicate abscess formation, or 
that would be amenable to drainage. However, this appearance 
suggests continued cellulitis.

Examination of osseous structures reveals mild degenerative 
disease at L5-S1 and are otherwise unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance of sigmoid colon anastomosis without 
obstruction or abscess formation.
2. Stranding and subcutaneous air along the lower abdominal wall 
in the midline, indicating cellulitis, but without discrete or 
drainable fluid collection

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
GI: Admitted in early morning on ___ the pt was made NPO with 
IVF resuscitation.  A abdominal/pelvic CT was done and 
demonstrated a stable sigmoid anastomosis without any fluid 
collections or free air.  Over the first night her urine output 
increased and a foley was not placed.  Due to her constant loose 
stools, toxin screens of C.diff were sent and returned negative. 
 By HD2, the nausea persisted an a GI consult was obtained.  The 
GI service believed the nausea to be related to baseline reflux 
exacerbated by her postop course, including a wound infection.  
Per their recommendations, she was started on an antacid and 
upon discharge she will follow up with a gastroenterologist to 
determine her H.pylori status.   Prior to discharge, she was 
tolerating a low residue diet and able to hydrate herself.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old Male who presented on ___ for 
a planned minimally invasive and possibly open radical distal 
gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy for locally advanced gastric 
carcinoma after chemotherapy. After placement of the Right upper 
quadrant port, insufflation revealed the right upper quadrant 
port to be penetrating the omentum. It appeared to miss the 
transverse mesocolon as well as the colon itself. During the 
surgery, there were visually obvious peritoneal deposits on all 
peritoneal surfaces in all four quadrants, which demonstrated 
undetected carcinomatosis, poorly -differentiated adenocarcinoma 
involving the peritoneum. For this reason, the procedure was 
then aborted. Post-operatively the patient was taken to the PACU 
until stable and then transferred to the wards until stable to 
go home. 

#NEURO: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization; pain was initially managed with dilaudid PCA 
which he was not using and then transitioned to tramadol which 
he got only one dose. Pain was very well controlled.

#CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.  

#PULMONARY: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization.  

#GI/GU/FEN: Before the procedure started, OR nurse was unable to 
pass Foley after attempt with standard and coude type. PA 
___, with usual sterile technique, re-attempted foley 
placement after 10cc urojet application with ___ and ___ 
coude-type catheters but was also unable to get passed the 
prostate. Urology was consulted and they performed a flexible 
cystoscope demonstrating a normal urethra. Using a flexible 
guidewire, cystoscope was advanced into the bladder. The scope 
was withdrawn and a ___ council was advanced over the wire, 
passed the prostate and into the bladder. The patient was 
discharged with the Foley in place with instructions to 
follow-up with urology as outpatient in 5 to 7 days for a 
voiding trial. No antibiotics were administered. The patient was 
tolerating a regular diet prior to discharge. 

#ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs 
of infection, of which there were none.  

#HEME: Patient received BID SQH for DVT prophylaxis, in addition 
to encouraging early ambulation and Venodyne compression 
devices. On POD1 the patient was restarted on his home 
enoxaparin before discharge.

#TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
--------------------

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating diet as 
above per oral, ambulating, and pain was well controlled. The 
patient was discharged home with the Foley catheter with 
appropriate teaching for care. The patient received discharge 
teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding 
verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___ 
___. You were admitted to our hospital for 
gastric cancer. You had an attempted Robot-assisted laparoscopic 
partial gastrectomy and gastroscopy on ___ without 
complications. You tolerated the procedure well and are 
ambulating, stooling, tolerating a regular diet, and your pain 
is controlled by pain medications by mouth. You are now ready to 
be discharged to home. Please follow the recommendations below 
to ensure a speedy and uneventful recovery. 

ACTIVITY:
- Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
- You may climb stairs. You should continue to walk several 
times a day. 
- You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit. 
- You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. 
Slowly increase your activity back to your baseline as 
tolerated.
- Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common 
sense and go slowly at first. 
- No heavy lifting (10 pounds or more) until cleared by your 
surgeon, usually about 6 weeks. 
- You may resume sexual activity unless your doctor has told you 
otherwise.

HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
- You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for 6 weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
- You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during the surgery.

YOUR BOWELS:
- Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain medicine 
such as oxycodone. If needed, you may take a stool softener 
(such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk 
of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
- If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.
- After some operations, diarrhea can occur. If you get 
diarrhea, don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty of 
fluids and see if it goes away. If it does not go away, or is 
severe and you feel ill, please call your surgeon.

PAIN MANAGEMENT:
- You are being discharged with a prescription for **oxycodone 
for pain control. You may take Tylenol as directed, not to 
exceed 3500mg in 24 hours. Take regularly for a few days after 
surgery but you may skip a dose or increase time between doses 
if you are not having pain until you no longer need it. You may 
take the oxycodone for moderate and severe pain not controlled 
by the Tylenol. You may take a stool softener while on narcotics 
to help prevent the constipation that they may cause. Slowly 
wean off these medications as tolerated. 
- Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.

If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon: 
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- chest pain, pressure, squeezing, or tightness
- cough, shortness of breath, wheezing
- pain that is getting worse over time or pain with fever
- shaking chills, fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
- nausea and vomiting, inability to tolerate fluids, food, or 
your medications
- if you are getting dehydrated (dry mouth, rapid heart beat, 
feeling dizzy or faint especially while standing)
-any change in your symptoms or any symptoms that concern you

Additional: 
*- pain that is getting worse over time, or going to your chest 
or back
*- urinary:  burning or blood in your urine or the inability to 
urinate

MEDICATIONS:
- Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just 
as you did before, unless you have been told differently.
- If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not 
to take, please call your surgeon. 

WOUND CARE: 
- dressing removal:
- You may remove your dressings tomorrow ___ and shower that 
same day with any bandage strips that may be covering your 
wound. Do not scrub and do not soak or swim, and pat the 
incision dry. If you have steri strips, they will fall off by 
themselves in ___ weeks. If any are still on in two weeks and 
the edges are curling up, you may carefully peel them off.
 Do not take baths, soak, or swim for 6 weeks after surgery 
unless told otherwise by your surgical team. 
-Notify your surgeon is you notice abnormal (foul smelling, 
bloody, pus, etc) or increased drainage from your incision site, 
opening of your incision, or increased pain or bruising. Watch 
for signs of infection such as redness, streaking of your skin, 
swelling, increased pain, or increased drainage. 

Please call with any questions or concerns. Thank you for 
allowing us to participate in your care. We hope you have a 
quick return to your usual life and activities.

Home with ___:
You had a Foley catheter in your bladder placed by urology on 
the day of your surgery after difficulty trying to place it.
You will keep the catheter until your appointment with Urology 
in 5 days (please call the number below to schedule your 
appointment), who will decide if you need it longer or attempt 
to remove it and see if you are able to void.
 Empty the bag as needed and as shown to you by nursing staff. 
You will be given a leg bag before your discharge, that you may 
use for short trips. This is a smaller bag that straps to your 
leg, to take home and wear if you are traveling outside your 
home. This holds a smaller amount than the bag you have now, so 
it needs to be emptied more often. Some people find it easier to 
use the larger bad when they are at home or carry it with them.

EXAMINATION:  CTA CHEST WITH CONTRAST  
COMPARISON:  Chest CT dated ___. 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
HEART AND VASCULATURE: There is no central pulmonary embolism.  
The thoracic 
aorta is normal in caliber without evidence of dissection or 
intramural 
hematoma.  The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are within 
normal limits. 
No pericardial effusion is seen. 
  
AXILLA, HILA, AND MEDIASTINUM: There is a 8.8 x 5.8 x 9.8 cm 
collection in the 
left breast, with density measuring 39 Hounsfield units, 
consistent with 
hematoma.  There are few foci of air within the collection, 
likely from prior 
aspiration, as well as few punctate hyperdensities at the 
periphery.  No 
axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy is present.  The 
right axilla 
is not included on the study.  No mediastinal mass. 
  
PLEURAL SPACES: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
  
LUNGS/AIRWAYS: Partially visualized lungs are clear without 
masses or areas of 
parenchymal opacification.  The airways are patent to the level 
of the 
segmental bronchi bilaterally. 
  
BASE OF NECK: Visualized portions of the base of the neck show 
no abnormality. 
  
BONES: No suspicious osseous abnormality is seen.? There is no 
acute fracture. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
8.8 x 5.8 x 9.8 cm left breast hematoma, with no evidence of 
active bleed.  
Please note, timing was suboptimal as the patient needed to be 
re-scanned due 
to incomplete field-of-view on initial images, however, the 
density of the 
collection was unchanged on all series.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on 
___ for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain.  
Admission abdominal ultra-sound showed calcification of the wall 
of the gallbladder as well as stable dilatation of the common 
bile duct. Next she had a hida scan which was positive for acute 
cholecystitis. On ___, the patient underwent laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy with an introperative cholangiogram, which went 
well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note 
for details). After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the 
patient arrived on the floor tolerating a clear liquid diet, on 
IV fluids, and po pain medicine for pain control.  The patient 
was hemodynamically stable.

Pain was well controlled. Diet was progressively advanced as 
tolerated to a regular diet with good tolerability. The patient 
voided without problem. During this hospitalization, the patient 
ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with respiratory 
toilet and incentive spirometry, and actively participated in 
the plan of care. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay.  On POD2, pt was 
noted to have saturated RUQ lap site dsgs with ongoing oozing, 
requiring a bedside cauderization which the patient tolerated 
well.  Post-cauderization, good hemostasis was achieved. 

At the time of discharge the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient was discharged home without services. 
The patient and her family received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with the use of an interpreter and the 
patient verbalized understanding and agreement with the 
discharge plan. She has a follow-up appointment scheduled in 2 
weeks in the ___ clinic.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital with acute cholecystitis. You 
were taken to the operating room and had your gallbladder 
removed laparoscopically. You tolerated the procedure well and 
are now being discharged home to continue your recovery with the 
following instructions.
 
Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the 
appointment listed below.
 
ACTIVITY:
 
o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid 
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, 
please call your surgeon.
o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"". 
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
o Remember to use your ""cough pillow"" for splinting when you 
cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain

you did before, unless you have been told differently.

take, please call your surgeon.
