presents to ___ ED with BRBPR found to have newly diagnosed 
anal adenocarcinoma.

# Anal adenocarcinoma: Patient initially presented with a 
history of changes in bowel habits and some bright red blood per 
rectum. Initial concern was for anal fissure, but after being 
seen by GI, they recommended evaluation by Colon and Rectal 
Surgery. They agreed that her lesion was concerning for 
malignancy, so she underwent EUS/biopsy with colorectal surgery 
___, which revealed lesion concerning for anal squamous cell 
caricnoma. Baseline CEA 20. Staging scans showed local disease 
without suspicious regional LAD, and no distant mets. She also 
underwent colonoscopy which showed no evidence of disease beyond 
the known anal/rectal lesion.

# Anal/rectal pain: Patient's pain was controlled initially with 
tylenol and dilaudid, then transitioned to tylenol and 
oxycodone. She was placed on an aggressive bowel regimen to keep 
her bowel movements soft so as not to cause additional pain. Her 
bowel regimen included docusate, colace and miralax, as well as 
being advised to increase and regulate her fiber intake. She was 
also given nitroglycerin 0.02% cream, 2% lidocaine ointment, 
Tuck's ointment and perineum care recommendations from wound 
care nursing.

# Pancytopenia: Patient with downtrending thrombocytopenia, also 
with neutropenia and stable anemia noted on admission. She was 
midly neutropenic. This was thought to be a combination of 
lenalidomide effect combined with anemia of chronic disease. No 
bony metastases were seen on initial cancer staging to implicate 
bone marrow spread. Heme/Onc consult from ___ recommended that 
this be followed as an outpatient but did not require inpatient 
work-up.

# IgG Myeloma: Patient with longstanding IgG MM, followed by 
___ Oncology for which she is on lenolidamide days ___ of 28 
days and dexamethasone 1x/week on weeks when she takes 
lenolidamide. The patient completed her last 3 weeks of Revlamid 
___. Also received Zometa ___. 
Lenolidamide/dexamethasone was held while patient was admitted 
due to risk of poor wound healing from biopsy. She was seen by 
Heme/Onc Consult from ___ who recommended following her 
pancytopenia and following up with her oncologist, Dr. ___ 
___ as an outpatient.

# Asymptomatic bacteruria: Patient has a history of chronic 
Klebsiella bacteriuria as a complication of UPJ obstruction s/p 
stent placement in ___. Patient was asymptopmatic from this 
during her hospitalization. She was monitored for active 
symptoms of UTI. 

# AFib on coumadin: Stable during admission. Did require 
adminsitration of FFP before biopsy and colonoscopy with FFP. 
Otherwise, was continued on home metoprolol, diliazem and 
warfarin. 

# Hypertension: Was relatively hypotensive initially, which 
prompted the team to hold lasix. Near the end of her hosptial 
course, she began to endorse some leg swelling, so we restarted 
furosemide ___. She was continued on diltiazem and 
metoprolol for the duration of her hospital stay as per above.

# CKD Stage 3: Cr 1.2 on admission, within recent baseline of 
1.4. Down to 0.9 at discharge.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient is not being discharged on Bactrim since she is not 
currently taking dexamethasone.
- Patient should follow-up with Dr. ___ as an outpatient who can 
then refer to Dr. ___ Colon & Rectal Surgery 
Multidisciplinary follow-up.
- Continue bowel regimen to prevent constipation and subsequent 
painful bowel movements

done to see if the cancer had spread, which it has not. You 
underwent a colonoscopy as well to look at the rest of your 
colon, which did not show any additional lesions.

You should make sure to eat lots of fiber to keep your bowel 
movements regular and use stool softeners to keep them soft. 
Avoid straining when you are having a bowel movement. Use the 
medications, ointments and suppositories prescribed to help with 
your pain.

STUDIES:

___ CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ PMHx obesity, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, CKD III 
(baseline 1.4) and chronic multiple myeloma and adenocarcinoma 
of anal canal (dx'ed ___ presenting for AFib with RVR.

ACUTE ISSUES:
-------------
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Pt presented initially with RVR 
in the 140s. Most likely in the setting of B-blocker and CCB 
being held due to hypotension. C. diff infection (see below) 
most likely contributing to hypotension. Pt received IV 
metoprolol and IV diltiazem in ED and was started on PO 
metoprolol/diltiazem on floor. She was also fluid resuscitated. 
Patient discharged with control of afib with RVR with PO metop 
and diltiazem at home doses. INR was supratherapeutic and 
coumadin was held (see below). 

# Hypotension: Per nursing home, she had intermittent 
hypotension requiring  discontinuation of her metoprolol and 
diltiazem. Most likely secondary to decreased PO intake/loose 
stools from C.diff infection. Adrenal insufficiency secondary to 
chronic steroid use in the setting of infection was ruled out 
with AM cortisol (30). 

# Funguria, bacteruria: Pt initially reported dysuria and UA x2 
showed large leuks/bacteria/yeast. Despite being contaminated, 
due to symptoms of dysuria, she was initially treated with IV 
CTX. Urine cultures eventually grew only yeast, prompting 
discontinuation of CTX. She was no longer symptomatic at this 
time, and she had no CVA tenderness or systemic symptoms of 
infection. She had a foley place initially for urine output 
monitoring, however, this was removed. Funguria will be treated 
with fluconazole for total 7 days of therapy. 

# C.difficile infection: Although no recent history of 
antibiotics, patient immunosuppressed and at rehabilitation 
facility. She was initially started on PO metronidazole on 
___, but this was changed to PO vanc, given that she is 
immunosuppresed and falls into the severe category. ___, 
___.

# Coagulopathy: INR on admission was 6.5. Most likely secondary 
to decreased PO ntake and exacerbated antibiotics. No active 
signs of bleeding. Once INR reached 7.8, she was given 2.5 mg PO 
vitamin K. She received additional 2.5 mg PO vitamin K on 
___. Coumadin was held on discharge.  

# Acute on chronic CKD (stage 3): Cr 1.2 (baseline 0.8-1.1). 
Most likely secondary to decreased PO intake and decreased 
cardiac output from afib with RVR. Creatinine improved with IVF.

# Lower extremity edema: Multi-factorial. Most likely venous 
stasis vs diastolic heart failure, especially in the setting of 
afib with RVR, vs hypoalbuminemia. Pa/lateral film in ED showed 
no cardiomegaly or pulmonary vascualar congestion to suggest 
decompensated systolic heart failure. Pt on furosemide at home. 
Albumin was 3.0. Furosemide held on admission due to ___. Edema 
was managed with pneumatic boots. Furosemide was restarted at 40 
mg on discharge. 

# UPJ obstruction s/p stent placement ___ c/b persistent 
Klebsiella bacteruria: Pt scheduled for stent replacement soon. 
She had no CVA tenderness on exam and creatinine was stable 
after IVF. Pt was scheduled to have stent replaced on ___, 
but procedure was cancelled due to supratherapeutic INR. Per 
Urology, pt's INR needs to be <3.0 and she will need this 
procedure in the next ___ months. 

# Troponinemia: Most likely strain from RVR vs decreased 
clearance in the setting of ___. Peaked at 0.02 before 
downtrending.

# Hyperlactatemia: Lactate 2.6 on admission. Most likely 
secondary to dehydration versus ineffective cardiac output from 
RVR. Peaked at 2.6 before downtrending.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
---------------
# Weakness: She had generalized total body weakness, with the 
lower extremities worse than upper extremities. Also with the 
left ___ greater than right ___. No documented previous CVA 
to which asymmetry can be attributed. Most likely deconditioning 
and myopathy from dexamethasone, versus myositis or 
cerebrovascular event, both thought unlikely. CK was within 
normal limits. ___ worked with patient and she was discharged 
back to rehab.

# Leg pain: Most likely osteoarthritis. She does not have 
diabetes to suggest neuropathy. She continued home oxycodone 10 
mg qHS.

# Pancytopenia: Patient with stable neutropenia, anemia, 
thrombocytopenia improved from prior, thought to be secondary to 
lenalidomide as well as anemia of chronic disease.

# Anal adenocarcinoma: Diagnosed recently in ___. T2N0M0. 
Staging scans showed local disease without suspicious regional 
LAD, and no distant mets. Baseline CEA 20. Has plans for 
colorectal surgeon Dr. ___ diverting ostomy. S/p port 
placement in ___. Plans for chemo/radiation. Updated 
oncologist.

# Anorectal pain: Her bowel regimen included docusate, colace 
and miralax, as well as being advised to increase and regulate 
her fiber intake. She was also given nitroglycerin 0.02% cream, 
2% lidocaine ointment, Tuck's ointment and perineum care 
recommendations from wound care nursing. Bowel regimen was held 
in the setting of loose stools. 

# IgG myeloma: Patient with longstanding IgG MM, followed by 
___ Oncology for which she is on lenolidamide days ___ of 28 
days and dexamethasone 1x/week on weeks when she takes 
lenolidamide. The patient completed her last 3 weeks of Revlamid 
___. Also received Zometa ___. 
Lenolidamide/dexamethasone was held during admission due to 
infection. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
--------------------
- C.diff infection, Severe: Needs PO vancomycin 125mg PO QID 
until ___ for total 14 day treatment course.
- Funguria: Three urine cultures grew >100,000 cfu/ml of yeast. 
She was started on fluconazole treatment, per her Urologist. D1 
= ___, D7 = ___.
- Ureteral stent replacement: Was scheduled for replacement on 
___, but cancelled due to supratherapeutic INR. Her stent 
can be replaced when her INR is therapeutic (2.0 - 3.0). When 
therapeutic, please call her Urologist Dr. ___ to schedule a 
stent replacement. She will also see him on ___.
- Supratherapeutic INR: Will need daily INR checks to follow INR 
until therapeutic so Coumadin may be restarted. If uptrending 
x72hours, consider 2.5mg PO vitamin K (in the absence of normal 
gut flora due to C. diff infection).
- Diastolic heart failure: Patient restarted on lower dose of 
furosemide 40 mg. Uptitrate as necessary based on volume status 
and kidney function.
- Myeloma: Revlamid/dexamethasone held during admission and on 
discharge. Please call her Oncologist Dr. ___ to discuss 
restarting on ___.
- Rectal adenocarcinoma: Stool softeners should be held until 
frequency and consistency of BM normalizes.

IMAGING
==============================
CXR (___):
No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.

Head CT w/o contrast (___):
1. No acute intracranial abnormality. 
2. Please note MRI of the brain is more sensitive for the 
evaluation of acute infarct. 
3. Atrophy and probable small vessel ischemic changes as 
described. 
4. 15 mm right posterior neck probable dermal inclusion cyst as 
described. Recommend clinical correlation and correlation with 
direct examination.

MICROBIOLOGY
==============================
URINE CULTURE (Final ___: 
      MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT 
WITH SKIN
      AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION.
BLOOD CULTURE x 2: NGTD 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with AFib on coumadin, UPJ obstruction s/p stent placement 
in ___ c/b chronic Klebsiella bacturia, IgG myeloma on 
lenolidamide, and recently diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the anal 
canal who presents with altered mental status.

# Subacute congitive decline: Patient presenting from assisted 
living facility with several days of progressive AMS. On 
admission was A+O X 1 without focal deficits but quickly 
improved to orientation x3. Differential included infectious 
etiology (ie UTI), mild dementia per family report or subacute 
hemorrhage given supratherapeutic INRs. NCHCT obtained on 
___ and showed no acute intracranial abnormality. 
Initially covered with ABX for possible to be UTI (see below) 
but ABX stopped with urine culture unrevealing. TSH and B12 WNL. 
Given hx of rectal adenocarcinoma, considered potential brain 
metastasis, however with no localizing symptoms and low burden 
malignancy so head MRI was deferred. Please arrange 
neurocognitive work-up to exclude dementia vs 
depression/pseudodementia as outpatient given mental status 
largely notable for apathy and pt being withdrawn with 
relatively good attention and orientation which makes an acute 
encephalopathy less likely.
.
# Pyuria: Patient has a history of chronic Klebsiella 
bacteriuria as a complication of UPJ obstruction s/p stent 
placement in ___. Seen previously by ID who recommended not 
treating unless symptoms. Given that she presented with altered 
mental status, she was started on ceftriaxone. However, urine 
culture on ___ returned with mixed flora and CTX stopped.  
.
# Anal adenocarcinoma: Diagnosed recently in ___. T2N0M0. 
Staging scans showed local disease without suspicious regional 
LAD, and no distant mets. Baseline CEA 20. Has plans for 
colorectal surgeon Dr. ___ diverting ostomy. Home bowel 
regimen of metamucil, senna, colace was continued.
.
# AFib: CHADS = 2. Patient was rate-controlled during 
hospitalization. INR 3.6 on admission. Home warfarin was held 
given supratherapeutic INR. Rate-control agents with home 
diltiazem and metoprolol was also continued. Warfarin restarted 
at lower dose on ___.
.
# Hypertension: Normotensive. Home BB/CCB and furosemide were 
continued.

ca.

She had reportedly mentioned worsening rectal pain over the past
several days as well as bright red blood on the tissue paper. 
She
denies melanotic stools. 

She had labs checked at the outpatient office today which showed
Hct of 29.3, which is roughly baseline. Because of her lack of
follow through but interest to pursue surgery, she was directly
admitted for pain control and surgical evaluation. 

ED: VS ___ HR 106-124, BP 107/76-136/82, RR 15, 100% RA. 
Received
5 mg IV morphine. Initial labs in ___ ED showed Hct of 15, but
was 27.7 when rechecked. Before the recheck, GI was consulted 
for
a possible GI bleed and plan was to admit to ICU. She received 5
mg IV Vit K. However in absence of frank melanotic stools with a
H/H that was baseline just several hours prior to admission, the
low Hg was suspected to be erroroneous and on recheck Hct 27.7.

She was evaluated by colorectal surgery who recommended
""admission to medicine for appropriate oncologic evaluation and
pain management. We recommend she be evaluated by radiation
oncology for short course pre-op radiation, followed by

#ANAL ADENOCA: Per Dr. ___: Admitted to ___ ___ for
BRBPR. Found to have anal adenocarcinoma, T2N0 based on MRI and
CT. Seen by Dr ___ in the hospital from surgery but has
been noncompliant with f/u with her despite multiple outreaches
from her office.

#MM: ___ woman who presented with anemia in ___.  Further testing demonstrated an M-spike of
approximately 3.3 g/dL, IgG was 5800 mg/dL.  Eventually, the
patient was referred to Hematology, IgG increased to 7100mg/dL 
at
the start of treatment.  Initial Hematology consult was ___.  Bone marrow biopsy revealed 60% of her bone marrow
occupied by plasma cells, cytogenetics demonstrated 
translocation
of chromosomes 11 and 14, also monosomy 13.  Skeletal survey was
negative.  Initial beta 2 microglobulin was 4.08, she started
cycle 1 of Revlimid and dexamethasone on ___, 
Revlimid
at 25 mg.  She was admitted to ___ on ___,
with pneumonia, she was also coagulopathic and quite leukopenic. 

She was discharged on ___.  On
___, she presented with severe back pain, and she has
sustained a compression fracture of L3 vertebra.  Her white 
blood
cell count was still low, the Revlimid was held, and restarted 
on
___ at a lower dose of 15 mg, in combination with
weekly dexamethasone at 20 mg.  She was started on Zometa.  The
patient did well on this lower dose of Revlimid with a nice
improvement in her IgG and M-spike, M-spike going down to 1.0
g/dL by ___, and her IgG going into the normal range 
at
the same time, she continued on Revlimid 15 mg every days ___,
with weekly dexamethasone at 20 mg, repeated every month, with

___ CXR
Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of the right 
ventricular outflow tract.  The double tube has been removed.  
There is substantial distension of the stomach that might 
potentially benefit from the NG tube insertion.  What appears to 
be a E ureteral stent is partially imaged. Bilateral pleural 
effusions, right more than left are present. Vascular congestion 
is noted, borderline with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. 

___ KUB
1. A right double J stent projects over the expected location of 
the right renal pelvis and bladder.  The stent is unchanged in 
position since ___. 
2. The stomach is distended with air. 

___ TTE
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left 
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The estimated 
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated 
with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. 
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets 
are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild 
to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild 
to moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the 
findings are similar.  

___ Renal US
1.  Moderate hydronephrosis and cortical thinning on the right.  
Mild 
hydronephrosis on the left.  These findings are unchanged from 
CT ___. 
2.  A large pleural effusion is unchanged from ___. 

___ CXR
As compared to the previous radiograph, the right sided J-stent 
is unchanged. The previously severe gastric over distension has 
further increased in severity and is now massive. 

___ CXR
As compared to ___, the patient has received a new 
nasogastric tube.  The tube is located in the middle parts of 
the stomach.  The previous overinflation of the stomach is no 
longer present.  The lung volumes remain low.  Moderate 
cardiomegaly.  Moderate bilateral areas of atelectasis and mild

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman a PMH significant for AFib on 
coumadin, UPJ obstruction s/p stent placement in ___ c/b 
chronic Klebsiella bacturia, IgG myeloma on lenolidamide, and 
adenocarcinoma of the anal canal (followed by Dr. ___ 
admitted to ___ for evaluation of anemia (Hgb 8.6) with 
course complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR requiring ICU 
admission for dilt gtt, Acute of chronic kidney injury, 
?osteomyelitis from sacral decubitus ulcer now transferred to 
___ for debridement of sacral ulcer.  Became hypotensive and 
quite anemic on the floor with H/H of ___ and was transferred 
to the MICU ___. 
  She peacefully passed away with her family and family pastor 
present in the room at ___ on ___. 
 
#Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The pt consistently required 
nasal cannula up to 6 L while on the floor. This was thought to 
be due to volume overload and increased work of breathing. While 
in the CCU pt became more lethargic and an ABG showed 
hypercarbic respiratory failure.  She was intubated by 
anesthesia.  CXR showed large bilateral pleural effusions and 
she was grossly anasarcic.  IP placed a right chest tube to 
drain the effusion which showed that it was malignant with 
cytology showing adenocarcinoma.  She was extubated successfully 
on ___ and was weaned down to room air thereafter.  She was 
able to be comfortable on room air for the rest of her 
admission.

# Encephalopathy: although the pt's mental status had noticed to 
be declining on the floor, she was still able to answer 
appropriately. After extubation, the pt was noted to be very 
lethargic and minimally responsive. EEG was done which showed 
triphasic waves consistent with an encephalopathy. The pt was 
trialed on Ativan and Keppra. Her mental status remained very 
poor in spite of continued Keppra.  Neuro signed off after head 
imaging was unrevealing.  Mental status continued to wax and 
wane through the rest of her time. 

# Stage IV surgical dehiscence: Patient had correction of 
abdominoperineal resection defect with a right vertical rectus 
abdominis muscular cutaneous flap in ___ following 
resection of anal cancer. She presented to the hospital with 
stage IV, MRSA + sacral ulcer with concern for osteomyelitis, as 
wound probes to bone. CT scan with no mention of sacral 
osteomyelitis. GI deferred to plastics as they did flap surgery. 
Plastics does not recommend surgical intervention at this time. 
MRI shows no signs of osteomyelitis. This wound remained stable 
during her hospital course. 

# ___: Baseline Creatinine 0.8. Creatinine on admission was 2.1 
in setting of diuresis but also possible hypotension from afib 
with RVR. Pt is grossly volume overloaded with hypoalbumenemia. 
Concern for prerenal vs. intrinsic with possible multiple 
myeloma involvement vs obstructive. Creatinine remains above 2.0 
today. Renal consulted and believed that her ___ was 
predominantly secondary to obstruction. After stent exchange by 
urology ___, renal function improved with a Cr to 1.5 with IV 
fluids and remained stable. 
 
# Gastric Distension: Patient developed nausea and 1 episode of 
vomiting ___ with increasing distention. And xray ___ 
showed significant gastric distension. NG tube was placed and 
>1L was drawn off. Patient's reported symptomatic improvement. 
Patient continued to have ostomy output throughout episode. No 
mass appreciated on exam though obese abdomen. Patient not on 
narcotic medication. On ___, NG tube was clamped without 
recurrence of distention, patient denies nausea or distension. 
Unable to get CT abd due to poor kidney function, but got OSH CT 
read by our radiologists. It was notable for new retroperitoneal 
mass encasing aorta throughout abdomen. It is touching and 
possibly invading ___ and ___ portion of duodenum, potentially 
explaining gastric obstruction symptoms. Invades pancreatic 
head, explaining ductal dilatation. Also surrounding common 
iliac vessels, and both ureters (hydronephrosis worse since 
___. Speech and swallow was consulted who said the pt 
should be strict NPO. Tube feeds were started.  

# Tube feeds: On ___ Ms. ___ was no longer tolerating 
her tube feeds due to very high residuals.  Tube feeds were 
stopped and she was given nutrition with D5NS at 75/hr.  ___ 
attempted to place the Dobhoff tube post-pyloric but they were 
unable to pass the tube through the pylorus and noted contrast 
barely trickles through ___ obstruction. In family meetings the 
family was informed that the feeding tube could not be advanced, 
and that other options such as TPN would likely harm the pt more 
than help her because of her risk for bloodstream infection and 
metabolic derangements.  

# Metastatic anal adenocarcinoma: large retroperitoneal mass 
compressing the abdomen and constricting the aorta at the level 
of the iliacs noted on CT from OSH, thought to be metastasis 
from her known anal adenocarcinoma. Per onc, not a candidate for 
chemotherapy, so likely not worth biopsying even though 
definitive diagnosis would not otherwise be reached. Recommend 
getting palliative care involved and having goals of care 
discussion with family.  First family meeting was ___ and 
son, ___, wanted us to do everything we could to help Ms. 
___. This continued to be a theme during her hospital stay, 
and several meetings were held with the family to discuss goals 
of care.  On ___ it was decided to switch to focusing on her 
comfort only.

# Volume overload: Likely from diastolic heart failure but will 
need to rule out hypoalbuminemic state, and cirrhosis. Patient 
with gross volume overload with 2+ ___ edema, bilateral effusions 
and CT with anasarca on abdominal imaging.  TTE unchanged from 
previous with EF 55% and no gross valvular dysfunction. TSH 
elevated, T4 WNLs. Patient given albumin ___ with good 
response.  However, patient still significantly overloaded.  On 
___ she was anuric and hypotensive despite having 
significant lower extremity and abdominal edema.  She was 
transferred to the MICU on this day.  While in the MICU she was 
stabilized and pressors were downtitrated.  Poor response to 
Lasix alone but given Lasix and Chlorothiazide with good UOP.  
 
# Hematuria: Unclear cause but patient was on anticoagulation. 
Concern would be primarily for tumor infiltration. Hematuria 
intermittent, but seems to recur during transport. Potential 
mechanical irritation. Patient continues to pass dime sized 
clots. Stent exchange done ___ by urology, with improvement in 
her hematuria.  Hematuria with clots returned on ___.  
Urology recommended CBI which was started ___.  She had 
CBI intermittently throughout her stay to relieve foley 
obstructions. 
 
# Normocytic Anemia: Hgb at ___ 8.6. No evidence of 
bleeding. She does have stage III CKD. MCV within normal range 
and iron studies not particularly suggestive of iron deficiency 
anemia with ferritin of 781. Folate level of 7.4 and B12 of 411. 
Concern could possibly be for chronic low grade bleed from gut 
or hematuria. (transfused evening of ___.  Hgb remained 
stable in the 7's until ___ when H/H dropped to ___.  
This same day she triggered for hypotension of 86/Doppler.  As 
she was anuric at this  time there was concern of intraabdominal 
bleeding and was one of the indications for MICU transfer.  Pt 
had episode of gross hematuria requiring CBI and pRBC 
transfusion for BP control.  Pt required Vasopressin and 
Phenylephrine while in the MICU but was able to be weaned off.  
She required intermittent pRBC transfusions during her time in 
the MICU.
 
# AFib on coumadin: CHADS 2 of 3. Hemodynamically unstable with 
RVR upon arrival, but controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol.  
She remained in AFib during her hospital stay.  Due to her 
hematuria and dropping H/H, blood pressure medications and 
ultimately SQH were discontinued on ___.   Pt put on an 
esmolol gtt as she had afib with RVR into the 130s on her first 
day in the ICU. She was taken off the esmolol drip and 
thereafter controlled with IV metoprolol and achieved good 
control on PO metoprolol with heart rates in the ___. 

# Hypertension: Currently normotensive.  See above for issues 
with hypotension and reason for MICU transfer ___. 
 
# IgG Myeloma: Patient with longstanding IgG MM, followed by 
___ Oncology. Currently not on revlimid or dexamethasone. 
Kappa:lamba increase, but can be seen in kidney disease.  Atrius 
oncology followed patient throughout hospital stay.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of falls, 
chronic headaches, and poor oral intake who is admitted for 
failure to thrive.
.
* Gait instability
This is probably multifactorial. Dehydration was a significant 
factor upon admission. Her hyponatremia, likely hypovolemic in 
etiology, may also have been relevant to her overall sense of 
weakness. Though she was admitted with concern for possible 
Parkinsons, she does not have any clear exam findings to suggest 
this such as tremor or cogwheeling. NPH is worth considering, 
but seems less likely. There may be a vestibular component of 
her gait instability as well, especially given her multiple ENT 
procedures. She has outpatient neurology follow-up scheduled. A 
cardiac contribution was considered given her history of prior 
syncope with question of sick sinus syndrome. After fluid 
resuscitation, patient no longer orthostatic and Na trending up. 
She was evaluated by physical therapy who felt that it was safe 
for her to go home with physical therapy. 

.
* Hyponatremia
By history, likely hypovolemic in etiology and improving on 
discharge. HCTZ could be contributory, and was held on discharge 
as patient appeared euvolemic with good BP control off the HCTZ. 
 Patient stated her appetite was better on discharge (possible 
hyponatremia was contributing).

.
* Bradycardia
Prior cardiac workup raised question of sick sinus syndrome, and 
patient had bradycardic rate, <2 second pauses on tele. TSH was 
within normal limits. Outpatient cardiology follow-up is 
scheduled with Dr. ___.
.
# Noncardiac Chest pain
On evening of admission, patient c/o left sided stabbing pain 
under her rib, worse when she pressed on it and also following a 
meal. No N/V/SOB/diaphoresis/radiation. She was ruled out for MI 
with serial unchanged ECGs, two sets negative CE. Her pain 
resolved with maalox and tylenol and did not return.

.
* Headaches
Appears to be consistent with her chronic headache syndrome, 
thought to be cervical in etiology by neurology. History less 
suggestive of other etiologies such as migraine, tension, or 
even temporal arteritis (but ESR was 3). Continued soft cervical 
collar at night per neuro recs. Pain resolved with tylenol.

The patient reports feeling unwell 1 day PTA, with no specific 
complaints, but with general fatigue, baseline chronic headache. 
  She describes bending over to pick up a napkin. Upon standing

IMAGING
L-SPINE PLAIN FILMS:
Minimal anterolisthesis of L4 upon L5 and minimal retrolisthesis 

of L1 upon L2, of indetermiante age. Recommend clinical 
correlation for point tenderness. No acute fracture seen. 
Degenerative changes of the lumbar spine. 
.
CXR:
Right lower lobe granuloma is stable since ___. 
Flattening of the diaphragms and hyperinflation of the lungs is 
compatible with COPD. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. Heart 
is borderline in size. Degenerative changes of the spine are 
noted. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo ___ speaking F with CAD, chronic ear infection who 
presents with presyncope and fall at home.  
.  
# Presyncope: Likely orthostasis in setting of HCTZ use and 
possible mild dehydration. Hyponatremia may have also 
contributed. Patient ruled out for MI. Neurological exam had no 
focal deficits. There was no evidence of infection, however 
urine cx was pending at discharge. Patient has bradycardia ___ 
SSS, but this is a chronic issue and patient is asymptomatic 
with bradycardia on the floor, and responded appropriately to 
exercise.  No events on tele. Patient was not orthostatic after 
receiving gentle IVF. Physical therapy consult cleared patient 
for independent ambulation with walker. 
HCTZ was discontinued. Patient will have her BP monitored off 
this medication by her PCP, and may require a replacement 
medication. Amitrityline was another candidate for causing 
confusion and falls, however patient has noted benefit from this 
in terms of headaches. If falls continue, could consider 
stopping Amitrityline as well. 
. 
# Hyponatremia: Patient has h/o hyponatremia in setting of HCTZ, 
possibly with mild SIADH component as well (since Na did not 
completely normalize when taken off of HCTZ). Patient had brain 
MRI as outpatient which showed only moderate microvascular 
disease, which is unlikely to explain hyponatremia. Patient does 
have evidence of COPD on CXR, but no other intrathoracic 
pathology to cause SIADH. Urine osm were intermediate, so no 
clear SIADH picture. 
Patient did start taking HCTZ taking on her own over the last 
few days for leg swelling. This likely accounted for worsened 
hyponatremia at admission. After holding the HCTZ, giving IVF, 
and encouraging POs, sodium was in normal range.   
Patient was instructed not to take HCTZ, and to instead use 
compression stockings for leg edema. 
.
# Lower extremity edema: This was very consistent with chronic 
venous insufficiency. Patient describes swelling that only 
occurs over the course of the day, and improves with rest and 
elevation. She has not been wearing compression stockings. 
Otherwise patient had no evidence of volume overload on exam. 
She is at risk for CHF given CAD and past MI, and should 
continue to weight herself daily.
.  
# Sick sinus syndrome: Followed by Dr ___ as 
outpatient. No need for pacemaker given appropriate response to 
exercise. This episode is highly unlikely to be cardiac in 
etiology. Sinus bradycardia on tele. Asymptomatic.  
.
# L gluteal pain: No fracture noted on L-spine films. Likely 
soft tissue trauma from fall.    
.   
# Hypercalcemia: Borderline and chronic, with mildly elevated 
PTH in past. This degree is very unlikely to be causing 
symptoms.    
.  
# Anemia: Hct 28 in baseline range.   
.  
# HTN:  continue lisinopril.  
.  
# Hyperlipidemia: continue statin   
.  
#: Headaches: chronic, likely related to chronic ear 
infections/mastoiditis.   
.  
# Otitis media: Right ear chronically infected. Per report, has 
used ear dropts. Patient does not complain of worsening 
pain/symptoms in her ear.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you. You were admitted for an 
episode of dizziness and falling. You had been taking HCTZ, a 
diuretic which can lead to dehydration and low sodium levels in 
your blood. Your sodium level was low, and improved before you 
left the hospital. You were treated with intravenous fluids and 
the HCTZ was stopped. You did well with physical therapy and 
your heart rate and blood pressure were normal. 
.
You also had leg swelling. This is caused by chronic venous 
insufficiency, which means that the valves in your veins get 
leaky over time and cause blood to pool in your legs. The 
treatment for this is elevating your legs and wearing 
compression stockings. 
.
The following changes were made to your medications
- STOP taking HCTZ

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old ___ speaking female with HTN, CAD s/p MI, HL, 
and vascular cognitive impairment who presented with nausea and 
vomiting. 
.
#. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient likely had a viral 
gastroenteritis and she continued to have mild nausea with some 
vomiting while inpatient. She was cleared by physical therapy 
and was able to tolerate POs before discharge.
.
She was also tested for influenza while here given some nasal 
congestion with the above symptoms. Pre test suspicion for this 
was low given that she did not have myalgias or other systemic 
symtpoms. The test was negative.
.
We also considered mild pancreatitis given an elevation in her 
lipase upon admission. This decreased on the second day of 
admission and remained normal and the patient tolerated POs well 
before discharge. Therefore, pancreatitis was thought to be 
unlikely.

___ ___ speaking HTN, CAD s/p MI, HL, and vascular cognitive 
impairment, hx of afib on pradaxa presenting with feeling 
'unwell'. Noted to be bradycardic to ___ in ED. In-house had 
episodic bradycardia to ___. On telemetry this appeared to be 
aflutter with variable block (2:1 block all the way to 8:1 
block). Pt asymptomatic during these episodes. Per discussion 
with Dr. ___ (o/p cardiologist), patient likely has enough 
intrinsic nodal disease that diltiazem is not needed for rate 
control for flutter, so home diltiazem 180mg held. Patient 
continued to have episodes of bradycardia, but these were fewer 
in number. For blood pressure control patient started on 
amlodipine 5mg.

OTHER ACTIVE ISSUES
# Hyponatremia: Patient's sodium noted to be 120 on admission. 
Without treatment trended spontaneously up to 129 on discharge.

# HTN: Continued on lisinopril 40 mg daily. Given that diltizem 
was held, we started patient on amlodipine 5mg for lack of nodal 
blockading effects. Patient's blood pressure on discharge was 
running high in 150s-160s. 

# Lumbar radiculopathy: continued home lidocaine patch and 
amitryptiline. 
# Pleural effusion: In house did not have hypoxia. CXR showed 
decrease in size from prior in ___. 
# HL: cont pravastatin 10 mg daily  
# CAD s/p MI:  Continued Pravastatin, and ASA. No BB given given 
given bradycardia.
# GERD: stable. Cont protonix 40 daily

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure participating in your care. You came to the 
Emergency Room feeling ill, but were not able to fully explain 
what was making you feel unwell. While in the Emergency Room, we 
found that your heart rate was low. We did an EKG (an electrical 
map of the heart) to better characterize this slow rhythm. The 
EKG was not markedly different from the ones you had previously. 
We monitored you and you had slow heart rates often while you 
were in the hospital. These episodes did not correlate to your 
symptoms.

We held one of your heart medicines, the Diltiazem, because this 
can block the conduction of impulses through your heart and 
contribute to this slow heart rate. 

At the same time, we found that your sodium is a little bit low. 
 This improved over the course of your stay.

Please STOP Diltiazem
Please START Amlodipine 5mg daily.  This is for your blood 
pressure.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is an ___ with atrial fibrillation/flutter on 
dabigatran, coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure 
(LVEF 60% in ___, hypertension/hyperlipidemia, and vascular 
dementia who presents with nausea and headache. She is 
___ only, and collateral information is obtained 
from her sister ___. According to her sister, she was in her 
usual state of health until days to a week prior to admission, 
when she developed nausea, initially without vomiting, with 
onset of frequent nonbloody, nonbilious emesis on the night 
prior to admission. She also experienced intermittent diffuse 
headaches, consistent with chronic of unclear etiology, over the 
same period. At least as far as her sister is aware, she has not 
experienced fevers/chills, chest pain/palpitations, cough, nasal 
congestion/rhinorrhea, sore throat, shortness of breath at 
rest/on exertion, difficulty lying flat, abdominal pain, loose 
stools, hematuria/dysuria, or myalgias. She has not been exposed 
to sick contacts or made any dietary changes. Her sister does 
indicate that her appetite has been poor for some time, leading 
to unintentional weight loss (""lots"") over a ___ period. She 
experiences chronic intermittent peripheral edema.

Of note, she was admitted most recently from ___ for 
episodic asymptomatic bradycardia to ___ attributed to atrial 
flutter with variable (2:1 to 8:1) block. Home diltiazem was 
held, given degree of intrinsic nodal disease, and amlodipine 
was initiated along with preexisting lisinopril for blood 
pressure control, with pressures of 150s-160s systolic by the 
time of discharge. More recently, ___ found a 2-lb weight gain 
(133 lbs, up from 131 lbs at baseline) in association with 
bilateral pitting edema, right > left, on ___, at which time 
patient denied shortness of breath. Spironolactone was initiated 
by her PCP ___ ___ for symptomatic diastolic heart failure, 
including peripheral edema and pleural effusions, but was 
discontinued within weeks due to hyponatremia; she reportedly 
has become hyponatremic on other diuretics in the past. She has 
no home oxygen requirement.  
 
In the ED, initial vital signs were as follows: 97.2 112 170/76 
15 100% 3L. Admission labs were notable for Hct of 33.7 
(consistent with baseline), platelets of 142 (consistent with 
baseline), and proBNP of 3220 (no priors available). CXR 
revealed bilateral pleural effusions, cardiomegaly and mild 
edema suggesting fluid overload, and possible underlying 
consolidation. She received acetaminophen 650mg x1, ceftriaxone 
1g x1, azithromycin 500mg x1, and furosemide 40mg x1, with 
1100cc UOP. Vital signs at transfer were as follows: 98.4 70 
165/83 18 100%. 

On arrival to the floor, patient reports that she is not in 
pain. Further discussion is difficult due to language barrier.

mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen, 
but may be underestimated due to Coanda effect and acoustic 
shadowing from the mitral annulus calcification. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a small 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric LVH with normal global and 
regional biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic stenosis. 
Mild aortic regurgitation. At least moderate mitral 
regurgitation.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Hospitalization Summary: 
Ms. ___ is an ___ yo ___ F with atrial 
fibrillation/flutter on dabigatran, coronary artery disease, 
diastolic heart failure (LVEF 60% in ___, 
hypertension/hyperlipidemia, and vascular dementia who presented 
with nausea and headache and was found to be in acute-on-chronic 
diastolic heart failure in the setting of NSTEMI.

Active Issues:
#NSTEMI: Although viral infection was suspected initially on the 
basis of history of nausea/vomiting obtained from her sister, 
revised history of nausea without vomiting in the absence of 
sick contacts obtained from the patient via interpreter raised 
concern for acute coronary syndrome, with nausea representing 
anginal equivalent. While admission EKG was negative for acute 
ischemic changes, subsequent EKG on hospital day 2 demonstrated 
new T wave inversions in II, III, aVF, and V3-V6 in association 
with rising troponinemia of 0.07 to 0.11. She received 81mg 
aspirin x4 and atorvastatin 80mg, and home Pradaxa was held in 
favor of a heparin drip. She was transferred from medicine to 
___ for further management. On ___, troponins peaked at 0.11 
and then downtrended. MBs were flat. BNP was elevated to 3220 
and it was thought the the primary pathology was CHF causing 
heart strain and troponin leak. Heparin gtt was discontinued 
after 48 hrs and dabigatran was restarted. Aspirin was increased 
to 325 mg qday and statin to atorvastatin 80 mg qday. 

#Acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure: She was found to be 
in acute-on-chronic heart failure on admission, with clinical 
signs of volume overload, moderate bilateral pleural effusions 
and mild pulmonary edema on admission CXR, and elevated proBNP = 
3220. Although transiently hypoxic with 3-L supplemental oxygen 
requirement in the ED, she was on room air by the time of 
arrival to the floor, with approximately 2-L urine output to 
40mg IV Lasix in the ED. She was diuresed with 20- 40 mg IV 
lasix daily thereafter. She was to be discharged on ___ but had 
an episode of DOE while ambulating to the bathroom. CXR showed 
CHF and she was kept for further diuresis. Diuretic regimen on 
discharge was 20mg QD.  She has close f/u with PCP 1 week after 
discharge for volume status assessment and further titration of 
diuretics as necessary.  In addition she will be discharged with 
21 hours of service and ___ with instruction for daily weights 
and communication with PCP if weights increase.

Inactive Issues:
#Atrial fibrillation/flutter: She has a history of atrial 
fibrillation and flutter, including recent admission for 
bradycardia attributed to atrial flutter with variable block. 
Admission EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm, and she remained in 
sinus rhythm on telemetry. Home dabigatran was administerd 
initially, but subsequently held as above in the setting of 
NSTEMI. Dabigatran 75 mg BID was restarted prior to discharge. 

#Hypertension: Home lisinopril was continued. She remained 
hypertensive in-house and due to multiple drug allergies, imdur 
60 mg was started in addition.  She continued with isolated 
hypertension in the very early morning but was normotensive 
throughout the day after medication administration so no further 
changes were made.

#Hyperlipidemia: Home pravastatin was held in favor of 
atorvastatin as above.

#Anemia/thrombocytopenia: Hematocrit and platelets were 33.7 and 
142, respectively, on admission, consistent with recent 
baseline. She remained hemodynamically stable without signs of 
active bleeding.

#Gastroesophageal reflux: Home pantoprazole was continued. 

Transitional Issues: 
- monitoring of volume status and titration of diuretic 
according to weights/kidney function
- atorvastatin was increased to 80 mg and aspirin to 325 mg, 
which can be downtitrated per cardiology

Brief Hospital Course:
___ hx atrial fibrillation/flutter on dabigatran, coronary 
artery disease, diastolic heart failure (LVEF 60% in ___, 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, ?SSS, and vascular dementia who 
presents 12 hours post-discharge with possible syncope.

#Syncope: unclear etiology, tele with aflutter and 4:1 
conduction earlier now with sinus and occasional sinus pauses.  
Has had recent admissions for similar episodes of ""feeling 
unwell"" with and without syncope, attributed to her intrinsic 
nodal disease.  EKG unchanged, enzymes flat. ?whether her 
syncopal event was a sinus conversion pause.  Due to the 
recurrent and progressive nature of her symptoms, and her lack 
of support at home and concern that the next event could be 
terminal, she was discharged to a LTAC with plan to continue on 
telemetry for ___ weeks to capture any event.

#CHF: euvolemic upon admission and discharge.  Continued 
aspirin, lisinopril, lasix 20mg qday.  Might need further 
titration of her diuretics pending volume status.

#CAD: continued aspirin, atorvastatin, imdur.  No chest pain.  
EKG without changes, enzymes flat.

#HTN: started imdur on last admission.  Noted that when taken 
both at the same time in the AM she had BPs in the 100s 
transiently; this was changed to lisinopril HS and imdur AM.

#Afib/flutter: not symptomatic.  No rate control due to 
intrinsic nodal disease.  On dabigatran 75 BID.

Pt unable to provide history, but per nursing home and OSH 
notes, in early AM on ___, pt fell and was discovered by nursing 
home RN. RN at that time noted that pt was confused and 
lethargic. HR at that time per report was in the ___. EMS was 
activated and pt brought to OSH ER. En route, EMS report 
indicates that heart rates were labile, but there are no EKG 
strips and unclear if pt received any cardiac medications. At 
OSH ER, pt's EKG revealed bradycardia to 20 with ventricular 
escape and no signs of atrial activity. The pt was then given 1 
mg of atropine with no effect and then transcutaneously paced 
for 1 hour. She was then noted to have HRs in the ___ and atrial 
activity. She was then transferred to ___ for possible PPM. 

Here at ___, noted to be intermittently lethargic and poorly 
responsive. CT head and neck negative. EP was consulted for 
possible PPM and initially recommended admission to ___, 
deferred PPM for the time being. She continued to be 
intermittently bradycardic to the ___ in the ED, but given that 
she has a history of previous bradycardia and has been 
asymptomatic with her episodes, she was felt to be stable for

akinetic.   
3. The left atrium is mildly dilated.   
4. There is mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.   
5. Estimated RV systolic pressure is moderately elevated at 55 
mmHg.   
6. Compared to the previous echo of ___, there is no 
significant change.

CXR ___
FINDINGS:  
Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Left-sided 
AICD is noted with single lead terminating in the right 
ventricle.  Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours 
are normal. Lungs are clear. No pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities are detected. 
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ M with h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy (s/p PCI/stent, CABG, 
ICD pacemaker) c/b systolic CHF (LVEF 27%), L MCA stroke, and 
perirectal abscess who presents with hypotension and new ___ in 
the setting fluid restriction while taking multiple diuretics 
and anti-hypertensives. 

#Hypotension: Pt presented with a baseline SBP in ___ over past 
year, was fluid restricting given history of pulmonary edema, 
presented with SBP in 60-70s in ED. After 500cc fluid bolus, SBP 
returned to baseline and pt was asymptomatic. Patient was not 
orthostatic. Bolused additional 1L NS. Hypotension seemed likely 
attributable to self fluid restriction in the setting of 
multiple diuretic and anti-hypertensive medications. Losartan, 
Spironolactone, Carvedilol and Torsemide were held on discharge. 
Patient was instructed to schedule primary care to have 
follow-up of his laboratory values.

___: Rise in pt's Cr to 2.8 from baseline of 1.1 with 
associated BUN/Cr >20. UA was unremarkable. Pt was maintaining 
UOP, w/ no history to suggest post-renal obstruction. Elevated 
pro-BNP suggestive of ventricular overload c/w history of 
ischemic cardiomyopathy, possible cardiorenal contribution to 
___. Overall findings were pre-renal ___, likely ___ decreased 
effective circulating volume in the setting of hypotension and 
fluid restriction in pt with underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy. 
He responded well to 1.5L IVFs, with a creatinine of 1.8 at time 
of discharge. He was instructed to improve his PO intake to 1.5L 
per day (has hx of CHF exacerbations). Antihypertensives were 
held at time of discharge. 

#Hyperphosphatemia: Phos to 5.1 on ___. Likely ___ renal 
insufficiency. He was given a low phosphate diet for one day.

#Normocytic Anemia: H/H down to 11.3/33.8 on ___ AM. Had low 
suspicion for hemolysis or acute blood loss. Was thought to be 
likely dilutional after fluids and was consistent with pt's 
normal range.

RESOLVED ISSUES: 
#Leukocytosis: Patient presented with transient leukocytosis, 
which downtrended to wnl ___ AM, likely ___ acute stress 
reaction. CXR/UA was not concerning for infection. Further 
infectious workup was not pursued.

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
#Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: s/p L ICD placement. No evidence of 
volume overload on exam ___. Losartan, Spironolactone, 
Torsemide, Carvedilol in were held in the setting of hypotension 
and ___, and also held on discharge.
#Hypertension: Losartan, Spironolactone, Torsemide, Carvedilol 
were held as above. 
#Hyperlipidemia: atorvastatin was continued without issue.
#History of MCA stroke: continued home warfarin without issue.

History of dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy, ___ Class II, EDW 
previously documented as 185-187lbs, but likely closer to 
190-195lbs given relatively dry RHC at this weight. On 
presentation he was well compensated. RHC was performed while 
inpatient which had largely normal pressures and it was 
discovered that his cardiomems was not calibrated correctly and 
still is reporting falsely elevated numbers. He had a few days 
off diuretics due to NPO status for procedures and mild 
hypotension, then restarted on his home dosing at discharge. He 
previously had a CPET that demonstrated poor function. This 
should be repeated now that he is optimized to reassess his need 
for LVAD/transplant.

as an outpatient with an outpatient dentist with no need to hold 
apixaban. If there are concerns from his primary dentist, he can 
be referred to our outpatient ___ clinic for extraction. 
- Underwent right heart catheterization on ___ which 
demonstrated only mildly elevated filling pressures including a 
mildly elevated PASP, which is significantly improved from 
prior. Vasodilator study was not performed given low pulmonary 
pressures.

pulmonary edema (R>L) and enlarged mediastinal/hilar lymph 
nodes. Given these findings, IP was consulted and he underwent 
bronchoscopy w/ EBUS and lymph node biopsies on ___. Per 
pulmonology, unclear etiology of the lymph nodes. Initially 
thought to be just pulmonary edema but RHC showed he was fairly 
euvolemic. Other possibilities include prior granulomatous 
disease or, less likely, lymphoma.

IMAGING
___ CT C/A/P:
1. Severe T12 compression fracture with slight retropulsion of 
the superior T2 endplate, indeterminate age. 
2. Multiple fractures of posterior and lateral ___ ribs, 
some of which demonstrate developing callus, suggesting subacute 
chronicity. 
3. Acute appearing right L1 transverse process fracture, and 
probable T10 and T11 spinous process fractures. 
4. Status post aortic bifemoral bypass with complete occlusion 
of right bypass graft. 
5. 3.5 cm fluid collection encasing the left bypass graft in the 
left lower quadrant, likely representing a seroma. 
6. Apparent filling defect in the left common femoral vein, 
likely mixing 
artifact.  However, ultrasound is recommended to evaluate for 
possible DVT. 
7. UIP pattern of pulmonary fibrosis in the bilateral lung 
bases. 
8. Diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis. 
9. 4.2 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm at the level of the aortic 
hiatus. 

___ L ___:
IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower 
extremity veins. 

___ CT head:
1. Mild left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage. No prior studies 
available for comparison. 
2. Presumed arachnoid cyst in the left middle cranial fossa. 

___ TTE:
The left atrial volume index is normal. There is no evidence for 
an atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler.
The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild 
(non-obstructive) hypertrophy of the basal
septum with a normal cavity size. There is normal regional left 
ventricular systolic function. Global left
ventricular systolic function is normal. The visually estimated 
left ventricular ejection fraction is 60%. Left
ventricular cardiac index is normal (>2.5L/min/m2) No 
ventricular septal defect is seen. There is no resting
left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Normal right 
ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. The
aortic sinus diameter is normal with normal ascending aorta 
diameter. The aortic arch diameter is normal.
There are simple atheroma in the abdominal aorta. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.5 cm2). There 
is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral leaflets
are mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. There is 
moderate mitral annular calcification. There is no
mitral valve stenosis. There is mild [1+] mitral regurgitation. 
Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets appear structurally normal. There is trivial
tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Adequate image quality. Moderate low gradient aortic 
stenosis. Normal biventricular systolic
function.

___ XR shoulder/humerus:
1. No fracture or dislocation. 
2. Multiple focal lucencies in the left humeral shaft could 
reflect osteopenia but raise concern for multiple myeloma or 
diffuse metastatic disease, which could be further evaluated 
with MRI, SPEP, and UPEP. 
3. Moderate to severe degenerative changes of the 
acromioclavicular 
glenohumeral joints. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is an ___ with history of dementia, PAD, HTN, 
CAD, COPD, prior pelvic fracture s/p hip replacement who 
presented to an OSH with an unwitnessed fall and was transferred 
to ___ due to CT head showing SAH. Transferred to the medicine 
service for encephalopathy. 

# Encephalopathy, toxic/metabolic: Patient was acutely altered 
on admission with waxing and waning mental status consistent 
with delirium on baseline of mild dementia. Found to have 
symptomatic UTI which was a like contributor as well as 
pain/trauma from her fall. She was started on antibiotics and 
improved back to baseline.

# Small left frontal traumatic SAH: Sustained in her fall. She 
had repeat head CT that showed stability. She was evaluated by 
neurosurgery who felt no surgical intervention was needed. Her 
home aspirin and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin were started 
on ___. Her goal blood pressure was under 160 and was maintained 
throughout her hospitalization. Per neurosurgery she did not 
need seizure prophylaxis and did not need neurosurgery follow up 
as an outpatient. Sutures were placed for her head laceration 
and can be removed on ___. 
 
# T12 compression fracture
# L1 transverse fracture: Per orthospine, likely chronic and 
unrelated to recent fall. She worked with ___ who recommended 
rehab. She is weight bearing as tolerated and ROM as tolerated. 
She should follow up with spine clinic 2 weeks after discharge. 
Pain control was with lidocaine patch and Tylenol. Her home 
tramadol was restarted on discharge at reduced dose.  

# Fall: She suffered an unwitnessed fall and had poor memory of 
the event. She is on a number of medications that could 
pre-dispose to falls including multiple antihypertensives (and 
had positive orthostatics in-house) and sedating/pain 
mediations. Symptomatic UTI likely contributer as well. A TTE 
revealed moderate AS. Telemetry revealed rare short runs of 
self-terminating SVT. Low suspicion overall for cardiac cause of 
her fall. Her antihypertensives were held with acceptable blood 
pressures throughout (SBPs < 160). Her tramadol and gabapentin 
(which had been newly started/uptitrated) were also held. 
Tramadol was restarted at a lower dose on the day of discharge 
and well tolerated.
 
# Urinary tract infection: patient with urinary frequency and 
pansensitive E coli in her urine culture. She was treated with 
ceftriaxone starting ___ and discharged with one day of 
cefpodoxime to complete a ___nemia: She was found to be anemic on admission around 7s with 
a small drop to 6.4 for which she received 1U pRBC with 
appropriate increase. Her H/H remained stable thereafter. Per 
her family she has chronic anemia. She may have element of MDS 
as she has borderline thrombocytopenia as well. She has a 
hip/buttock hematoma that remained stable. Iron studies showed 
an elevated ferritin and normal Fe, consistent with ACD. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[] Patient discharged on cefpodoxime for 400 mg q12h for one day 
to complete a 5 day course of antibiotics for UTI
[] Patient with sutures in place; can be removed ___
[] Patient found to be anemic with unknown baseline; if not 
previously evaluated could consider further work up
[] Xray of the L humerus revealed: ""Multiple focal lucencies in 
the left humeral shaft could reflect osteopenia but raise 
concern for multiple myeloma or diffuse metastatic disease, 
which could be further evaluated with MRI, SPEP, and UPEP.""
[] Patients antihypertensives (atenolol and lisinopril) were 
stopped on admission due to fall and orthostatic hypotension. If 
she develops hypertension, can consider restarting.
[] Patient started on metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily for 
cardiac protection as atenolol was stopped
[] Patient's tramadol was decreased to 50 mg TID PRN
[] Patient's gabapentin was held on discharge

**The patient was seen and examined today and is stable for 
discharge. Greater than 30 minutes were spent on discharge 
coordination and counseling.**

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital after you fell and hit your 
head. You had a bleed in your brain but did not need surgery. 
You were found to have a small fracture in one of the small 
bones in your back but this was thought to have been present 
before you fell. You will follow up with spine doctors after ___ 
leave the hospital for this. You also hit your arm and hip but 
did not have any broken bones. 

You were found to have a urinary tract infection and treated 
with antibiotics. This may have contributed to your fall. You 
also were found to have low blood pressure when you stand up, so 
your blood pressure medications stopped. You can discuss 
restarting them with your primary care doctor.

You were found to be anemic (to have low blood counts) and got a 
blood transfusion. Your blood counts were stable after this. You 
may need further evaluation of your anemia by your primary care 
doctor unless this has already been done.

It was a pleasure participating in your care. We wish you all 
the best in the future!

Sincerely,

Your ___ team

STUDIES
==========================================================
___ EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU 
monitoring study because of a discontinuous background 
throughout the recording, characterized by ___ Hz theta 
frequency activity with admixed delta activity and occasional 
suppressions, consistent with a moderate to several 
encephalopathy. Background reactivity is present as seen during 
bedside examination when a more continuous and higher voltage 
theta frequency activity is observed. There are no definite 
epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. Note is made 
of an irregular cardiac rhythm throughout the recording with an 
average heart rate of 70 to 130 bpm on a single channel EKG. 

___ ECG Baseline artifact. Sinus tachycardia. Non-diagnostic Q 
waves in leads I and aVL. Borderline intraventricular conduction 
delay of the left bundle-branch block type. ST-T wave 
abnormalities. No previous tracing available for comparison. 
Clinical correlation is suggested. TRACING ___ CXR IMPRESSION: 1. Widened mediastinum may reflect low lung 
volumes and supine positioning, however mediastinal great vessel 
injury cannot be excluded. If concern exists, recommend chest 
CTA. 2. Pulmonary vascular congestion and probable mild 
pulmonary edema. 3. Bibasilar atelectasis. 4. ET tube with tip 6 
cm above carina. Enteric tube with tip projecting over stomach 
fundus. 

___ CT SPINE 1. No acute fracture or malalignment. 2. 
Heterogeneously enlarged left thyroid gland with punctate 
calcification suggestive of a goiter. Consider thyroid 
ultrasound if the patient has not had one previously if the 
patient's condition stabilizes. 3. Mild pulmonary edema. 

___ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial 
hemorrhage or mass effect. 2. Subtle subcortical white matter 
hypodensity in the right frontal lobe which is nonspecific, 
potentially related to chronic small vessel infarction, but can 
also be seen with vasculitis, demyelination, or infection. This 
can be further assessed with MRI. 

___ CTA CHEST AND ABDOMEN IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of 
pulmonary embolism to the segmental level. 2. Fusiform dilation 
to 53 mm of the extrahepatic common hepatic and common bile duct 
as well as the cystic duct, compatible with type I choledochal 
cyst. Hyperdense anti-dependent material within the gallbladder 
lumen may represent sludge, however underlying mass lesion is 
also of concern. Recommend non-urgent MRCP for further 
evaluation of biliary system and gallbladder when clinically 
appropriate. 3. A 3.5 cm heterogeneous, potentially enhancing 
left renal lesion, concerning for neoplasm. Patent ipsilateral 
renal vein. This could be further evaluated at the time of 
followup MRI/MRCP. 4. Ill-defined segment VII hypodense liver 
lesion. Attention on followup imaging. 5. Possible non-displaced 
sternal fracture. 6. Appropriately-positioned ET tube and 
enteric tube. 7. Mild pulmonary edema which is most conspicuous 
in the lung apices. Bibasilar atelectasis. 8. Mildly 
heterogeneous thyroid is partially imaged. 

___ ECHO The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect 
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly 
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis 
(LVEF = 25 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left 
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right 
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall 
contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending 
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

___ CXR IMPRESSION: 1. Slight interval worsening of vascular 
congestion and mild pulmonary edema. Additionally, the heart 
appears slightly larger. 2. High position of the endotracheal 
tube, 7 cm from the carina. Advance 2-3 cm for more secure 
placement. 

___ CXR IMPRESSION: Subtle new confluent opacity in the right 
perihilar region,? related to subtle progression of CHF 
findings. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. 
Attention to this area on followup films is requested. 

ERCP report
___ 
Impression: Bulging of the major papilla 
Biliary dilation compatible with cholydocal cyst. 
A 5cm by ___ straight plastic biliary stent was placed 
successfully. Brisk drainage of cloudy bile and contrast from 
the biliary tree was noted endoscopically and fluoroscopically.  
 
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum 

___ CXR IMPRESSION:  
In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and 
support devices are essentially unchanged. The patient has taken 
a somewhat better inspiration. Nevertheless, there is 
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bibasilar 
opacifications.

s/p PEA arrest, septic shock on 3 pressors, and ___.

ACUTE ISSUES:
# PEA arrest: Unclear precipitant, but most likely metabolic 
derangement in the setting of diarrhea, leading to bicarbonate 
losses and consequential hypokalemia, acidosis, and hypovolemia 
driving an arrhythmia. While he had shortness of breath, hypoxia 
does not seen likely. Bedside echo did not show any evidence of 
tamponade and CXR/CT did not show evidence of tension 
pneumothorax. EKG and echo also did not support ACS. Serum tox 
does not favor a toxin ingestion.  He was maintained at strict 
normothermia for 48 hours. 

# Septic Shock: Patient presented in septic shock.  Source most 
likely cholangitis. Hypotension was refractory to volume 
resussitation and was required 3 pressors. Patient was found to 
have cholangitis and E. coli bacteremia which was treated as 
below. 

# AF with RVR: Patient presented with new onset afib with RVR. 
the pt has no history of AF. Tachycardia is likely induced by 
the use of multiple pressors, especially epinephrine. Due to 
patients hypotension he was loaded with amiodarone and 
transitioned to PO amiodarone. He then receieved dilt and then 
verapamil for additional attempts at rate control. He was in 
sinus rhythm on floor transfer. Started on coumadin 3mg on ___. 
Cardiology was consulted and recommended discontinuing 
amiodarone and verapamil and starting the patient on metoprolol 
and an ACEI. Metoprolol was started and titrated to 150mg upon 
discharge. He was not started on lisinopril 5mg as his renal 
function had just recovered. Patient should start lisinopril on 
___. 

# ___: Pt likely has some CKD at baseline, as Cr in ___ was 
1.7. Rapid rise in Cr unlikely to occur suddednly in setting of 
septic shock.  Urine microscopy with many muddy brown casts, 
unsuprising given his arrest and severe septic shock.  With 
prolonged dehydration and cardiac arrest, likely pre-renal 
azotemia developed into ATN. His uric acid level of 17.7 is very 
elevated and makes uric acid nephropathy possible and uric acid 
cystals were seen on urine microscopy. Per mother, took ___ 
and indomethacin for perhaps a few days prior to this event. 
Because of volume overload and low urine output patient was 
treated with continuous renal replacement therapy which was 
continued until ___. His renal function continued to improve, 
and he should be started on ACEI for heart failure on ___, in 
order to give his kidneys time to recover. On discharge, he 
appeared to be in post-ATN diuresis, so patient should be 
encouraged to keep hydrated with careful monitoring of I/O after 
discharge. 

# Respiratory failure: Not ARDS. Likely ___ cardiac arrest and 
acidosis. Pt initally had severe metabolic acidosis and 
permitted to hyperventilate to compensate.  Due to patients 
kidney injury and aggressive fluid resussitation. TTE showed EF 
25%, global hypokinesis, unclear chronicity. 

# Cholangitis and E. coli bacteremia:  Elevated LFTs in the 
setting of dilated CBD on imaging with choledochal cyst was 
suggestive of underlying cholangitis. ERCP findings included 
Cloudy bile, no frank pus. Ampulla was found to have with edema 
and erythema, possibly site of obstruction. ___ CBD stent placed 
in CBD, good bile flow after placement. Patient improved rapidly 
after ERCP and should continue ceftriaxone and flagyl until 
___. He will need surgery and ERCP follow-up for cyst removal 
and stent removal. 
 
# Thrombocytopenia: Unlikely a consumptive process as fibrinogen 
elevated and INR only midly elevated, making DIC unlikely. Heme 
was consulted to rule out TTP in setting of liver and renal 
dysfunction. Ehrlichia/anaplasmosis was negative. 
Thrombocytopenia was likely due to sepsis, and recovered quickly 
after source control for cholangitis. 

# Hyperglycemia: Pt had low FSBG on presentation at OSH and 
received 1 amp. He then became hyperglycemic in setting of 
sepsis and required insulin drip during that time.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Please start lisinopril 5mg on ___ if kidney function 
stable. Patient needs ACEI for likely acute heart failure, 
however needs a week prior to starting due to ___. 
-Patient in post-ATN diuresis. Encourage PO intake, monitor I/O 
and blood pressures to make sure he is not dehydrated. 
- Patient started on warfarin on ___ at 3mg due to concurrent 
use of flagyl. It was increased to 5mg on ___. Please monitor 
INR.
-Scheduled for appointments with surgery, ERCP, urology (concern 
for renal mass), and cardiology. 
- Does not need renal follow-up, but please schedule if kidney 
function worse or if metabolic acidosis does not resolve.
-Per cardiology, will continue warfarin, metoprolol, and 
lisinopril until his follow-up appointment. At that time, he 
will need repeat echo to assess LV function and may need an 
event monitor to determine whether he is still having episodes 
of A-fib.
- Recent CT scan showed a ""3.5 cm heterogeneous, potentially 
enhancing left renal lesion, concerning for neoplasm"". Warrants 
further evaluation by Urology once he recovers 
- Outpatient surgery f/u for choledochal cyst resection 
- ERCP f/u to take out stent

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___. You were admitted 
with weakness and diarrhea and were found to have an infection 
in your abdomen. You also experienced an event where your heart 
stopped and you were very ill afterwards. Your symptoms 
gradually improved with antibiotics and a procedure to place a 
stent in the duct your gallbladder drains into, and we gave you 
medication to control your heart rate. Our cardiology team saw 
you and started you on several new medications to protect your 
heart. You will need to go to rehab to regain your strength and 
will need to see several specialists, listed below, after you 
leave the hospital. Please follow-up with your appointments as 
listed below.

Please note that your CT scan showed a mass in your kidney which 
should be evaluated by Urology as an outpatient, as there is 
concern this could be a cancer. You will also need surgery to 
remove the cyst around your gallbladder to prevent future events 
like this from occurring. You also need to follow-up with 
cardiology to reassess your heart function and adjust your 
medications.

Take care, and we wish you the best.

Sincerely,
Your ___ medicine team

not consistent with syncope. Furthermore trops negative x2, EKG 
without changes. Telemetry monitoring without events.  No 
episodes of fall while inpatient.  He was able to walk with ___ 
with use of a cane. ___ recommended further therapy in his group 
home. 

# Psychosis: Per collateral info, prior to admission he was more 
lethargic than usual.  There was question of medication 
compliance as he administers his own meds independently.  He was

History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ year-old M (poor historian) with a PMH of
psychosis, mechanical falls with negative syncope w/u in ___,
T2DM (last HbA1c unknown, on metformin and insulin), and COPD
(last FEV1 unknown), who presents with a 2-week history of
weakness and cough with sputum production. 

He was in his usual state of health until 2 weeks ago, when he
began to feel weak and short of breath. Of note, he has had
similar episodes in the past that last for several days and said
directly that ""this feels like pneumonia to me."" This was
associated with a frequent cough productive of yellow-green
sputum and anorexia with poor PO intake. He denies hemoptysis,
fevers, chills, and night sweats. He denies orthopnea and PND. 
He
denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, hematochezia,
melena, dysuria, and hematuria. Yesterday, he experienced
worsening lightheadedness and he had frequent episodes of
tripping. He denies falls, LOC, or head strike with these
episodes.   

This morning, he had an episode of chest pain that was
midsternal, sharp, and pleuritic without radiation into the arm
or neck or worsened SOB. Concurrently, he was too weak to rise
from his chair. Last FSG 138. Given his weakness and worsening
respiratory status, he presented to the ED.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year-old M (poor historian) with a PMH of 
psychosis, mechanical falls with negative syncope w/u in ___, 
T2DM (last HbA1c 7.1 in ___, on metformin and insulin), and 
COPD (last FEV1 unknown), who presents with a 2-week history of 
weakness and cough with sputum production concerning for CAP as 
well as orthostatic hypotension. 

# Cough: Likely CAP given leukocytosis (13k), malaise, sputum 
production, and LLL infiltrate on CXR. Never met SIRS criteria 
during hospitalization. He always saturated well on RA with no 
evidence of increased work of breathing. SputumCx indeterminate, 
urine legionella negative. He received a 5-day course of 
antibiotics with ceftriaxone/azithromycin (___). On 
discharge, he was feeling significantly better with no 
complaints of cough. 

# Dizziness/Weakness: The patient presented with orthostatic 
hypotension thought secondary hypovolemia in the setting of poor 
PO intake, given positive orthostatics and BUN/Cr > 20:1 
suggestive of dehydration. Patient relies on cane at home. ECG 
NSR, trops neg. CT Head with no acute process. Electrolytes WNL. 
Despite brisk fluid resuscitation and now likely euvolemic 
status, orthostatics remain positive and he has a persistent 
unsteady gait. Underlying etiology unclear, possibly autonomic 
dysfunction ___ DM versus medication (on clozapine). Per 
outpatient psychiatrist Dr. ___ has been on the same dose 
of clozapine for ___ years. Adrenal insufficiency unlikely as 
___ AM cortisol level 13.0. ___ evaluated him on ___ and 
recommended rehab. On discharge, his orthostatic vital signs 
remained positive and he continued to require assistance with 
walking. He was initiated on fludrocortisone 0.1mg QD on ___ 
with some symptom relief. 

# ___: Likely due to hypovolemia in the setting of poor PO 
intake given BUN/Cr > 20:1. Last baseline 0.95 in ___. We 
gave him IVF as above with resolution of his ___ to Cr 0.9. On 
discharge, his BUN/Cr were ___.

# Prior IVDU: Patient reports prior history of heroin use and 
""other drugs."" He gave consent for HIV testing. HIV, HepB, HepC 
were all negative. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
===============
# Psychosis: Continued clozapine. 
# Diabetes: RISS, held home metformin. Repeat HbA1c 7.2. FSGs 
120s-180s here. No evidence of diabetic foot ulcers. 
# COPD: Continued home fluticasone and tiotropium inhaler. 
# GERD: Continued home ranitidine. 
# CAD: Continued home ASA. 
# HTN: Held home lisinopril given orthostatic hypotension. 
# HL: Continued home gemfibrozil. Total Chol 221 Triglycerides 
379* elevated. HDL low at 25. Chol/HD 8.8, LDL calc 120. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=================== 
# Fludrocortisone: The patient was initiated on Fluricil on ___ 
at 0.1mg daily. This can be uptitrated at a rate of 0.1mg per 
week to a maximum of 0.3mg daily. 

# Transthoracic echo: The patient was scheduled for an 
outpatient echo. ECHO office will call patient to make 
appointment. He should follow up with a cardiologist to review 
the results.

# Nutrition: The patient arrived with evidence of dehydration. 
Please ensure that he is reminded to drink water and other 
fluids throughout the day, especially if he is feeling ill. 

# Former IVDU: HIV, HepC, HepB found to be negative on this 
admission. No evidence of active IVDU.

# ? Diabetic neuropathy: The patient intermittently reported 
reduced sensation and proprioception in bilateral distal 
extremities. His HbA1c was 7.2 on admission, which is mildly 
elevated. His orthostatic hypotension may also be an effect of 
autonomic neuropathy. His primary care physician should 
reevaluate this at their next appointment. 

# Orthostatic hypotension: He will be scheduled for an 
outpatient follow-up appointment with neurology to evaluate for 
potential causes of autonomic neuropathy. If negative, his 
psychiatrist should consider redosing of his clozapine to 
minimize potential side effects. His primary care physician 
should continue to work closely with him to ensure his diabetes 
mellitus is being treated adequately. 

# Blood cultures: Negative since ___, final result pending at 
discharge. If any growth observed, the patient will be notified. 


# Lipid panel: Total Chol 221 Triglycerides 379* elevated. HDL 
low at 25. Chol/HD 8.8, LDL calc 120. He should have a repeat 
lipid panel performed with his primary care physician and 
consider alternative agents/dosing to better manage his low HDL 
and high triglycerides.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with history of paranoid 
schizophrenia, COPD, Type 2 DM, urinary retention s/p indwelling 
foley catheter placement in ___, who presented from his 
group home with report of 1 day of fever prior to admission and 
altered mental status on the day of presentation to the ED 
(___). 

# Altered mental status/catheter associated urinary tract 
infection:
Patient hemodynamically stable on admission, but drowsy and not 
oriented. Afebrile, but WBC count of 27. Urinalysis consistent 
with infection in the setting of indwelling foley catheter. Head 
and neck imaging without acute abnormalities. He was without 
headaches, photophobia, or neck stiffness to suggest 
meningoencephalitis. Patient initially started on ceftriaxone; 
however, urine culture revealed ESBL E. coli resistant to 
ceftriaxone. Patient switched to meropenem, which he received 
from ___ to ___. Patient was switched to fosfomycin (1 dose) 
on discharge to complete a full antibiotic course. Foley 
catheter was replaced.

# Acute kidney injury:
Patient also noted to have acute kidney injury with Cr 1.5, 
likely prerenal in etiology, that resolved with IV fluids. Cr on 
discharge 1.0.

# Paranoid schizophrenia:
Patient's clozapine was held on admission, given altered mental 
status. He was seen by the psychiatry service for assistance 
with management. Clozapine was resumed at the suggestion of 
psychiatry at 100mg PO QHS, with plan for outpatient uptitration 
by primary psychiatrist.

# Normocytic anemia: 
He was found to have Hgb of 8.8-10.5 as compared to most recent 
baseline of 11.8. He was without signs of overt bleeding. There 
was low suspicion for hemolysis in the setting of normal TBili 
and lack of schistocytes on manual smear.

# Abdominal pain:
He experienced transient abdominal pain with benign abdomen, 
possibly related to urinary tract infection, though not 
specifically suprapubic. KUB was without signs of obstruction or 
perforation. Abdominal pain resolved prior to discharge.

# T2DM
He received long-acting insulin with sliding scale as needed. 
Home metformin was held throughout admission and resumed at 
discharge.

# COPD
Home fluticasone and tiotropium inhaler were held throughout 
admission and resumed at discharge.

# GERD/Reflux esophagitis
He received omeprazole in place of home ranitidine in the 
inpatient setting.

# CAD
Home ASA was continued.

# Hyperlipidemia
Home gemfibrozil was held throughout admission and resumed at 
discharge.

# Orthostatic hypotension 
Home fludrocortisone was continued.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
# Patient's clozapine was stopped on admission and restarted at 
100mg PO QHS by recommendation from psychiatry. Patient should 
follow up with outpatient psychiatrist for uptitration.
# Patient was found to have anemia with Hgb of 9.2. He should 
have a follow-up CBC with differential within 1 week and should 
be worked-up for iron-deficiency or other causes anemia if not 
improved; downtrending monocyte count, likely elevated on 
admission in the setting of infection, also should be ensured.
# Follow-up of coagulation studies to ensure downtrending INR 
(elevated to 1.4 on this admission likely in the setting of 
infection and poor PO intake, without overt signs of DIC) also 
advised.
# Patient found to have 10 RBC on urinalysis on this admission, 
likely in the setting of urinary tract infection; please assess 
for resolution of hematuria following resolution of urinary 
tract infection, though may be confounded if ongoing foley 
catheter needed.
# Patient should follow up with urology for foley catheter care 
and to assess whether ongoing foley catheter is needed.

This is an ___ year old man with past medical history significant 
for CAD s/p bare metal stents x2 in ___, systolic dysfunction 
(EF 35%), chronic atrial fibrillation on warfarin, VF arrest 
status pos pacemaker and ICD placement, and rectal cancer s/p 
resection who presented with melena.  Ten days prior to 
presentation, he began to notice that the stools in his ostomy 
bag were dark. The color was not frankly black, but darker than 
usual. He denied nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, pain after 
meals, epigastric pain, abdominal pain, constipation, or 
diarrhea.  He did aknowledge chronic dysphagia that had been 
persistent for many years.  He also denied syncope, 
lightheadedness, shortness of breath, and chest pain.  On the 
day of admission, he presented to his PCP's office with the 
complaint of black stools, and those stools were found to be 
grossly guaiac positive. Hence, he was admitted for further

Polyp in the fundus
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo man with chronic atrial fibrillation on coumadin, CAD s/p 
stents on plavix and aspirin, and history of rectal cancer s/p 
resection and ostomy reconstruction, presents with anemia and 
dark stools.  
 
1) Anemia/GI bleed: On presentation the patient was anemic with 
melena, but he was hemodynamically stable and relatively 
asymptomatic.  Hematocrit on presentation was 26.1 so he was not 
immediately transfused, but he did have large bore IV's inserted 
and received fluid boluses.  He was also started on BID PPI 
therapy and his anticoagulants (aspirin, clopidogrel, and 
warfarin) were held.  His second hematocrit had dropped to 23.3, 
but as there was not a great deal of stool or blood in his 
ostomy bag this was presumed to be more consistent with dilution 
than continued brisk bleeding.  Still, at that time transfusion 
was offered, but the patient was quite reluctant and as he 
continued to be hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic 
transfusion was held.  As the day progressed hematocrit rose 
back to 25 and remained stable throughout the rest of his 
hospitalization.  Gastroenterology was consulted on the day 
after presentation and planned to take the patient for EGD after 
allowing the INR to fall for a day.  Unfortunately, the INR 
remained elevated, but at that point gastroenterology elected to 
proceed with EGD with a plan not to do any interventions unless 
their was overt, active bleeding.  On EGD the patient had 
gastritis and duodenitis but no ulcers or obvious other sources 
of bleeding.  ___, no intervention was performed and the patient 
was discharged on BID PPI and with a reduced anticoagulant 
regimen to follow up in GI clinic.  Stools at discharge were 
non-melenic.  Hematocrit was greater than 25.    

2) CAD s/p BMS ___: The patient has history of coronary artery 
disease and had bare metal stents placed in ___.  
Nevertheless, he never had chest pain or other signs of active 
ischemia.  His aspirin and clopidogrel were held on presentation 
due to concern for active bleeding.  At discharge he was 
restarted on warfarin and aspirin but as it was greater than one 
year out from his stent placement it was considered safe to hold 
clopidogrel at discharge in order to decrease the number of 
anticoagulants the patient was taking.  The patient's 
cardiologist, Dr ___, was made aware of this decision and 
thought it was reasonable.  

3)Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has an EF of 35% by 
previous echocardiograms but never showed signs of acute volume 
overload or evidenced dyspnea in the hospital.  Initially, his 
aspirin, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, and diuretic were held in 
the context of potentially active bleeding and concern about 
hemodynamic stability.  These were all restarted prior to 
discharge.  

4)HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension but was never 
frankly hypertensive in the hospital.  His anti-hypertensives 
were initially held in the hospital and then restarted as 
described in the previous problem point.  

5)Chronic atrial fibrillation: The patient is on metoprolol for 
rate control and warfarin for stroke prevention.  His rate 
remained relatively well controlled even when metoprolol was 
being held. His warfarin was held on presentation but restarted 
after his procedure.  His INR never became subtherapeutic.  He 
will follow up with his PCP for further INR monitoring. 

As the patient was systemically anticoagulated no further DVT 
prophylaxis was given.  He was on BID PPI for GI bleed.  He 
tolerated a full diet prior to discharge.  He was full code.

Primary Diagnosis:
--------------------
Acute blood loss anemia
Gastritis with bleeding in setting of multiple anti-coagulants
.
Secondary Diagnoses:

Coronary Artery Disease
Chronic Systolic Heart Failure
Hypertension

 
Discharge Condition:
Good, tolerating PO's, with asymptomatic anemia and Hct stable 
>24 hours.  

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you were bleeding into 
your gastrointestinal tract so that blood was showing up in your 
colostomy bag.  The GI specialists passed a camera into your 
stomach (endoscopy) and saw some irritation of the lining of 
your stomach called gastritis.  We will medically manage this by 
giving you the acid blocking medicine (proton pump inhibitor) 
and by decreasing the number of medications you are on that 
encourage bleeding.  You will follow up in the GI clinic as 
well.  As your blood counts were stable we are now discharging 
you to complete your recovery at home.  

Your medications have been changed.  Your CLOPIDOGREL (PLAVIX) 
has been stopped; this was discussed with your cardiologist who 
agreed;  as you are now far enough out from your stent placement 
that this medication is not necessary.  
You have also been started on the proton pump inhibitor for 
blocking stomach acid.  This medication is called PANTOPRAZOLE 
(PROTONIX).  Please continue to take all other medications as 
prescribed.  We recommend you avoid alcohol for the next few 
weeks as your stomach lining heals.  

Please keep all scheduled follow-up appointments as these are 
important to help manage your health.  You will also need to 
have your INR rechecked next week as you were off this 
medication in the hospital and your dose will need to be 
re-titrated.  

Please call your doctor or go to the Emergency Room if you have 
fever>101, chest pain, shortness of breath, further black or red 
material in your ostomy bag, intractable nausea/vomiting, 
lightheadedness, fainting, or other concerning changes to your 
health.

Regarding your heart failure, you should weigh yourself every 
morning and contact your doctor if your weight changes > 3 lbs 
over the course of 24 hours.  Please limit your salt intake to 2 
gms/day.

** Head CT (___)
FINDINGS: There is no acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or 
infarct. The
ventricles and sulci are enlarged, consistent with age-related 
atrophy.
Chronic infarcts are noted in the right thalamus and left 
cerebellum.
Additional supratentorial and periventricular white matter 
hypodensities are consistent with small vessel ischemic disease. 
Calcifications are noted in the bilateral cavernous carotid and 
vertebral arteries.
 
Again seen is mild mucosal thickening and a mucous retention 
cyst in the left maxillary sinus, as well as some thickening in 
the right ethmoid sinus. The remaining paranasal sinuses and 
mastoid air cells are clear. Diffuse osseous demineralization is 
present. There are no fractures.
 
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. Chronic atrophy and 
old infarcts.
.
CT of C-Spine (___)
FINDINGS: There are no acute fractures. There is multilevel 
degenerative
disease of the cervical spine with osteophyte formation, disc 
space narrowing, subchondral cystic changes, and vertebral 
compression deformities at multiple levels, most marked from 
C5-C7. Multiple posterior disc-osteophyte complexes are present, 
without significant impingement of the thecal sac outline. There 
is moderate-to-severe facet and uncovertebral joint hypertrophy 
at virtually all levels, most severe at C3 and C4 on the right, 
with significant foraminal stenosis.
 
Note is made of partial fusion of the right first and second 
ribs.
 
The thyroid gland is heterogeneous, with a 5-mm hypodense nodule 
in the left lobe (3:76).
 
Left subclavian venous catheter courses in expected position.
 
IMPRESSION: No fractures. Cervical spine DJD.
.
Xray L spine PA/LA (___)
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute fracture or malalignment. 
Multilevel
degenerative changes.
.
Xray T spine (___)
IMPRESSION: Extensive degenerative disease. There is a superior 
endplate
compression of likely T11. Morphology suggests chronicity and no 
definite
posterior retropulsion is noted. If clinical symptoms are 
referable to this
region, consider cross-sectional exam for more sensitive 
evaluation.

Mr. ___ was admitted after a mechanical fall while going 
down the stairs. A CT scan of his head and C-spine neck, as well 
as xrays of the T and L spine were obtained. The T spine xray 
showed and old fracture at T11. The orthopedic spine service 
consulted on the patient and did not feel as if further workup 
was needed unless he developed severely worsening symptoms 
related to his spine. While in the hospital any acute back pain 
was controlled with oxycodone and valium. 
. 
2. Acute Renal failure with Hyponatremia
This believed to be due to dehydration ___ to over diuresis (pt 
was on furosemide and spironolactone as an outpt and reported 
significant recent weight loss). Pt was given IV fluids and 
diuretics were stopped in the hospital. He quickly felt better 
and his symptoms of unsteadiness and fatigue improved. Sodium 
levels stayed mildly low at 126 but creatinine quickly improved. 
Patient was advised to hold his diuretics for at least 24hrs 
after discharge.

3. EKG changes:
Pt had a very difficult EKG to interpret ___ to being paced and 
having some old bundle branch block abnormalities. Cardiology 
had been contacted while patient was in ER and indicated no 
intervention. Pt was ruled out for ACS with 3 sets of cardiac 
markers and placed on telemetry until this was done. Their was a 
mild elevation in initial troponin value but it did not increase 
and was attributed to the acute renal insufficiency. 

On discharge patient was instructed to hold his two diuretics 
for 24hrs and to monitor his dry weights closely and daily.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old gentleman with PMH including CAD s/p stenting,  dual 
chamber ICD, CHF LVEF of 40% mod MR, TR (___), atrial 
tach/fib on coumadin, s/p chemo + Rad + left coloectomy for 
rectal CA, h/o upper GIB from duodenal ectazia who was reffered 
by his PCP due to progressive fatigue and ___ Hct.
.
# Anemia: Mr. ___ had slowly ___ Hct prior to 
his admission w/o overt bleeding. On admission found to have 
microcytic anemia with Hct 24.7 and Retic. Index of 1.1%. 
Thought to be multifactorial d/t iron deficiency, CRF, Chronic 
disease. Concern for hemolysis was also raised (See ""Jaundice"" 
below). B12 and Folate were not deficient. Iron was low with 
Ferrittin at low end of normal range. He was hemodynamically 
stable throught his stay. Despite guiac negative stools history 
was concerning for potential sources of GI bleed including  s/p 
UGIB from duodenal ectasia and s/p rectal cancer. He underwent 
EGD which was normal. The patient declined colonoscopy at this 
time. Celiac serology was negative. He recieved a total of 3 
units of PRBC. Hct at discharge was 30.4 His coumadin was 
continued as he did not have signs of major bleeding. Omeprazole 
dose was reduced from 40mg BID to 20mg QD per normal EGD. Iron 
supplementation was started. He will require close monitoring of 
his Hct in the out-patient setting and further anemia workup 
including outpatient colonoscopy, UPEP, SPEP as well as 
hematology consultation for possible hemolysis. 
.
# CHF exacerbation. Mr. ___ has dilated cardiomyopathy 
with EF 40% per echo ___. He was clinically fluid overoladed on 
admission, likely ___ to decompensated HF in the setting of 
anemia. He was kept on his home doses of PO furosamide and 
recieved adittional IV furosamide dosing as well as PRBC for his 
anemia. Lisinopril, spironolacton and Metoprolol were continued. 
He had good urine output with this and his fluid status 
significantly improved to euvolumia at discharge. He will 
continue to follow-up with his outpatient cardiologist.  
.
# Jaundice: The patient was noticed to be Jaundiced and was 
found to have hyperbilirubinemia. Urobiilnogen + spoke against 
obstructive process. Raised LDH++ was concerning for hemolysis, 
but haptoglobin was normal and direct and indirect coombs 
testing was negative, no schistocytes were noted on smear. He 
does have chronic transamintis which is thought to be due to 
congested liver ___ to right heart failure. Worsening of liver 
congestion in the setting of decompensated heart failure may be 
the underlying cause of Jaundice. ___ syndrome is unlikely 
as he has no history of prior episodes of Jaundice. Trending of 
LFT's and further work-up should continue in the out-patient 
setting. Hematology consultation was arranged for work-up of 
possible hemolysis.   
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Admission Cr 1.7 up from 1.3 
at baseline, likely pre-renal failure in the setting of 
decompensated heart failure. Cr subsequently trended down to 
base-line with treatment of HF. Renal functions should be 
followed up in the out-patient setting. 

# Fever: Mr. ___ had a ___ temprature spike 
during a blood transfusion. Work-up for transfusion reaction was 
not concerning. Blood cultures were so far negative. He did have 
a cough but CXR was not concerning for pneumonia. UA was 
negative. He subsequently remained afebrile and had no 
leukocytosis. 
.  
# Atrial Fibrillation: patient is paced by dual chamber ICD. 
Rate control with BB and anticoagulatation with Warfaine were 
continued. His INR on discharge was 1.7. He will continue INR 
monitoring and warfarin dose adjustment in the out-patient 
setting.  
. 
# CAD: Patient is s/p stenting of the OM in ___ following 
cardiac arrest; His home medication regimen does not include 
aspirin and statin. He will continue follow up with his 
out-patient cardiologist. Initiation of aspirin and statin for 
seondary prevention should be considered.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o male with colon cancer s/p resection 
and radiation, CAD s/p stents, systolic CHF with EF 40-45%, 
dilated cardiomyopathy, afib, h/o cardiac arrest and complete 
heart block now with pacer/AICD, and history of GI bleed 
secondary to duodenal telangiectasia who is here from rehab for 
hemoptysis. Of note, he had lengthy TICU hospitalization for L 
___ rib fractures, R ___ rib fractures, a L hemothorax, a L 
dist clavicle fracture, and he is s/p trach and peg.
.
# Hemoptysis: Mr. ___ was noted to have blood tinged 
secretions via his trach. An OSH bronschoscopy was performed and 
reportedly saw bleeding inside the trachea with poor 
visualization. He was transfused 2 units of pRBC and transferred 
to ___. Here, he reported no resp distress. He is status post 
bronchoscopy with our pulmonary team on ___, which did not find 
an etiology of the bleed. Only suction trauma was seen, and this 
may be the primary etiology of his bloody tracheal secretions. 
While the cause of his hemoptysis remains uncertain, his 
hematocrits have remained stable and there are no signs of 
continuing hemoptysis or active bleeding. Chemical DVT ppx was 
held at time of discharge after he was HIT positive and given 
risk of bleeding with suction trauma.
.
# Respiratory distress: His respiratory distress has 
currentlyimproved. Post bronchoscopy, he was noted to be mildly 
tachypnic with RR ___ and was 88% on 15L NC. A CXR showed 
worsening pulmonary edema, and he received lasix with 
improvement in PACU. He was transferred to the MICU for closer 
monitoring. Of note, he was receiving intermittent lasix and an 
IVF bolus prior to bronchoscopy. He is typically on 50% FIO2 
with his trach mask. He was weaned from the ventilator, and was 
continued on albuterol MDIs. He was also treated with vancomycin 
and cefepime for HCAP, until his sputum Cx grew coag-positive 
staph sensitive to levofloxacin. He was started on an 8-day 
course of levofloxacin 750mg qday, of which the last dose will 
be on ___. Lasix 40mg PO daily was restarted on day of 
discharge. This should be titrated as needed.
-We recommend keeping the patient on the ventilator (MMV) 
overnight to decrease his work of breathing.
.
# Fever: The patient p/w low grade fever/temperature post 
bronchoscopy. His fever curve was trended, and cultures were 
sent. His urine and blood cultures showed no growth, while his 
sputum culture grew coag-positive staph as mentioned above. He 
was continued on levofloxacin.
.
# Anemia: His anemia was stable after 2u pRBC prior to transfer, 
and his hematocrits remained stable. There was no further need 
for transfusion.
.
# Asymetric swelling of LUE: His LUE was cooler than the RUE and 
more swollen than the right, but still had good pulses. Although 
his wife stated that his LUE has always been swollen, a doppler 
of the LUE was obtained which showed no evidence of DVT. The 
swelling appears to have reduced, although it still remains more 
swollen than the RUE. 
.
# Acute on chronic systolic CHF (40-45%): The initial physical 
exam showed leg edema and his chest x-ray suggest mild CHF. He 
was given 20mg of lasix in the PACU, and further diuresis was 
not undertaken in the ICU. He was started on Lasix 40mg PO daily 
(Previous home dose) on day of discharge. This should continue 
to be monitored. He was given free water flushes through his G 
tube for hypernatremia, which resolved during his stay.  
.
# Low platelet count: His platelets fell from 273 on admission 
to 107 prior to discharge. This drop was consistent with 
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, for which his heparin was 
discontinued. This was confirmed as his heparin antibody from 
___ was positive. His PLT count on ___ is 111. He was put on 
pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis given risk of bleeding with 
suction.
-He should not be given heparin.
.
# Hypernatremia: As above, he was given free water flushes for 
correction of his hypernatremia, which appears to have resolved. 
Free water flushes were continued at time of discharge.
.  
# Oral candidiasis: PO fluconazole was stopped prior to 
discharge.
.
Only evidence of bleed is suection trauma in L maintstem 
bronchus, needs to come back in 6 week from ___ for rpt 
bronch

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none 
 
History of Present Illness:
___ year old male with multiple co-morbidities including rectal 
cancer s/p resection and radiation in ___ now with colostomy, 
coronary artery disease s/p stents, systolic CHF, dilated 
cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation not on coumadin, cardiac 
arrest and complete heart block s/p AICD/pacemaker, recent 
trach/peg after prolonged hospitalization for rib 
fractures/flail chest s/p fall who presents with large amount of 
bleeding from colostomy and Foley. The patient also endorsed 
increased shortness of breath, weakness and fatigue. The patient 
had been recently admitted ___ to the ___ MICU for 
pneumonia and MRSA bacteremia/sepsis and had been discharged on 
Vancomycin and baby aspirin (for his atrial fibrillation and 
coronary artery disease).
.
In the ___ ED, initial vital signs were: Afebrile, HR70, 
BP107/53, RR24, 91% on trach vent. Given his tender abdomen, 
there was initial concern for an intrabdominal event. 
ACS/General Surgery was consulted and CT abdomen/pelvis was 
performed. As the imaging was negative, there were no acute 
surgical concerns; ACS recommended tagged RBC if he continued to 
bleed. GI was also consulted and recommended two units pRBC for 
Hct 22, IV PPI initiation. The patient also underwent PEG lavage 
which was clear but was passing small amounts of maroon colored 
stools. There was also initial concern for DIC but labs not 
suggestive of this (the patient has history of heparin induced 
thrombocytopenia but platelets normal). The patient has had 
hematuria in the past, with three-way foley in place.  
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient was resting comfortably in 
bed with trach/PEG, endorsing fatigue and abdominal pain. Per 
the patient's wife, the patient looked good on discharge two 
days ago but seemed under the weather on arrival to ___ 
___. When she saw him at 6pm yesterday evening, he was stable 
without signs of bleeding.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
___ M PMHx CAD s/p stenting, systolic CHF (EF40-45%), atrial 
fibrillation, recent hospitalization for MRSA bacteremia of 
respiratory source, who represented from ___ with hematuria and 
blood in colostomy bag, thought to be secondary to recent 
initiation of ASA, now resolved after holding ASA, 
hemodynamically stable x multiple days, being discharged to 
___.
.
ACTIVE
# Blood in Ostomy: Patient w/ history of UGIB secondary to 
angiectasias in the duodenum who presented w/ trace blood in his 
ostomy; patient remaining hemodynamically stable w/ PEG lavage 
negative; Trace blood in his colostomy bag suggests lower GI 
bleed; given temporal relationship to initiation of ASA, this 
was felt to most likely be an exacerbation of underlying issue; 
bleeding resolved with holding of ASA.  He received 2 units of 
pRBC on the day of admission.  His hemoglobin/hematocrit was 
thereafter stable.  Patient/family have declined scoping at this 
time but may be amenable to this as an outpatient (of note, 
colonoscopy in ___ was normal).  Continued patient's home 
omeprazole; held ASA (see below).  His cardiologist was notified 
because the patient is now no longer on aspirin or coumadin, but 
bleeding risk strongly outweighs stroke risk at this time.  
Patient will need to readdress issue of colonoscopy as an 
outpatient with outpatient providers.  Scheduled follow up with 
Dr. ___ on ___.  Please call Dr. ___ office to see if 
can get EGD sooner.
.
# Hematuria: Patient with a history of hematuria of uncertain 
etiology who presents w recurrence of bleeding, thought to be 
secondary recent initiation of ASA; holding of ASA resolved 
bleeding issue; patient will need to have outpatient follow-up

vancomycin treatment course (last day is ___ level was 
supratherapeutic during this hospitalization; adjusted dosing to 
500mg BID.  Patient will need Vancomycin trough on morning of 
___ and adjust dose as necessary. 
.
# Chronic Diastolic CHF: Patient w EF 55-60% (___) 
appearing fluid overloaded on admission; restarted patient's 
home diuresis with good urine output.  Continued home 
carvedilol.  Continued to hold lisinopril (had been held during 
recent admission) given normotensive without.  Could consider 
restarting as outpatient if he became hypertensive.  
.
# Sacral decubitus ulcer: Stage IV, significant. Appropriate 
wound care.  Continued oxycodone, lidocaine. Patient became 
loopy receiving oxycodone 5mg Q4H.  Is written for ___ 
Q4H:PRN for pain, but will need to be assessed prior to 
medication to make sure not continuing to get loopy.  Please 
assess at ___ and continue to turn the patient regularly 
minimizing weight bearing to that area.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: CHADS4 but off 
anticoagulation/antiplatelet secondary to history of GI bleeds, 
hemothorax in ___. Given bleeding on this admission he will 
likely be a poor candidate for ASA in the future.  Alerted 
outpatient cardiologist Dr. ___ this issue.  He 
has follow up with Dr. ___ on ___ and we will contact him 
as well on the day of discharge.

Studies:

CXR ___: No significant change from ___ radiograph, with 
cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral 
pleural effusions again noted.  Left lower lobe opacity is 
compatible with atelectasis and/or pneumonia. 

TTE ___: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left 
atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated 
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right 
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is 
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. An 
eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the 
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly 
underestimated (Coanda effect). Moderate [2+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with 
the prior study dated ___ (images reviewed), the degree of 
pulmonary pressures is much lower (likely underestimated as the 
IVC was not well visualized). No vegetations or abscesses 
visualized.

TEE ___: No vegetations seen on the cardiac leaflets. No mass 
or vegetation seen on the cardiac wires. Simple atheroma aortic 
arch. At least moderate in severity eccentric mitral 
regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild to 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  

BLE Ultrasound ___: Limited study demonstrates no evidence 
of right or left lower extremity DVT. 

CXR ___: As compared to the previous radiograph, the 
position of the 
tracheostomy tube and of the pacemaker wires is unchanged. 
Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with bilateral areas of 
atelectasis and substantial enlargement of the vascular 
structures at the lung hilus. Unchanged moderate pulmonary 
edema. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities. 

WBC scan ___: 1. Splenomegaly. 2. No focal source of 
infection localized.

Bilateral UE ultrasound ___: No evidence of upper extremity 
deep venous thrombosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Mr. ___ is a ___ year 
old male with h/o CAD s/p stenting, systolic CHF (EF40-45%), 
atrial fibrillation, h/o cardiac arrest with heart block s/p 
AICD/pacemaker, trach/PEG, and recent ICU admission with GI 
bleed, hematuria, and MRSA bacteremia, who presented from rehab 
with fevers and persistent MRSA bacteremia while on vancomycin.

#. MRSA Bacteremia: The source of the patient's persistent 
bacteremia was not found. He grew MRSA from multiple blood 
cultures at rehab and also on initial presentation despite 
appropriate vancomycin troughs. Multiple sources of persistent 
seeding were considered. He had a TTE and TEE which were both 
negative for vegetations and did not show any involvement of his 
pacer leads. A tagged WBC scan was performed to look for occult 
focus of infection which was negative. An upper extremity 
ultrasound was also performed to look for possible infected clot 
but was negative. His PICC line which had been recently replaced 
at ___ was removed. A new one was not placed until he 
had negative blood cultures.  He was continued on vancomycin and 
dosing was changed to 1g q48h.  Further blood cultures were 
negative.   Ultimately it was felt he likely has an endovascular 
source but it was not found during this hospitalization.  He 
should be continued on IV vancomycin for 6 weeks from the date 
of his last positive blood culture, with last day ___.

#. Pseudomonas and Klebsiella UTI: Given that he has an 
indwelling foley it was suspected that this might be 
colonization however his cultures were positive even after 
changing his foley. He was found to have pseudomonas in his 
urine as well as wound culture.  It was multidrug resistant 
pseudomonas and he was treated with tobramycin for a seven day 
course.  He needs one more dose of tobramycin 320mg IV x 1 when 
trough < 1.  He also grew multidrug resistant klebsiella in his 
urine and was started on a 7 day course of cefepime with last 
day ___. 

#. Fevers: He had fevers on admission felt to be related to his 
MRSA bacteremia.  Other cultures returned positive as above.  He 
also had a knee arthrocentesis which was not consistent with 
septic arthritis.  His PICC was changed after a 24 hour line 
holiday.  He was ruled out for C diff.

#. Acute renal failure: BUN/creatinine elevated to 70/1.7 on 
admission felt to be related to ongoing infection and poor 
forward floor from chronic systolic CHF.  His creatinine slowly 
improved with diuresis.

#. Chronic respiratory failure: He was continued on mechanical 
ventilation during this admission and was unable to be weaned to 
trach mask for any length of time.  This was felt to be related 
to chronic respiratory fatigue in addition to substantial 
pulmonary edema.  Diuresis was difficult due to his large 
obligate fluid intake, but was eventually acheived with lasix 
80mg IV q6h plus metolazone 2.5mg po bid.  His metolazone may 
need to be decreased over the next several days if he is 
overdiuresed as he was on average 1L negative on this regimen 
for the few days prior to discharge.  On the day of discharge, 
he was on pressure support ___, PEEP 5, FiO2 50% with TV in the 
300's.

#. Anemia: His hematocrit remained stable in the low 20's during 
this admission.

#. Chronic Diastolic CHF: Has EF 55%. He was continued on his 
home carvedilol.  His lisinopril has been on hold indefinitely 
and was not restarted due to renal failure.  He was diuresed 
with IV lasix and metolazone as above and will need his 
creatinine and electrolytes monitored closely with ongoing 
diuresis.

#. Sacral decubitus ulcer: Stage IV.  He was started on a 
fentanyl patch and continued on prn oxycodone for pain control.

#. Atrial fibrillation: His heart rate and blood pressure 
remained stable during this admission.  He is off 
anticoagulation due to h/o GI bleeding and hemothorax.  He was 
continued on carvedilol. 

#. Wound care: He was evaluated by the wound care team who 
recommended the following:
1. Follow pressure ulcer guidelines. First Step for fluid 
management. Turn q 2 hours.
2. Cleanse wounds with commercial wound cleanser. Pat dry.
3. Apply Aquacel ag to sacrum wound, cover with 4x4's and soft 
sorb dressing, secure with Medipore tape. Change daily.
4. BLE ulcerations - cover with Adaptic dressing, place 4x4 and 
wrap with Kerlix. Secure with paper tape.
5. No tape on skin.
6. Mid upper back ulcer - Apply Mepilex 4x4 and change q3 days.
7. Mid lower back ulcer - apply DuoDerm wound gel to bed to 
assist with autolytic debridement of yellow slough. Cover with 
Mepilex 4x4 dressing, and change q 3 days.
8. Apply Critic Aid clear skin barrier ointment to scrotal 
tissue to protect from fluid exposure daily. Elevate scrotum to 
assess with edema.
9. Waffles bilateral feet.
10. Apply aloe vesta ointment to dry intact skin daily.
11. Support nutrition and hydration.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Monitor I/O's closely and check electrolytes closely given 
large doses of lasix and metolazone.  ___ need to back off on 
metalazone if signs of overdiuresis.  However, would continue to 
aim for -500cc daily I/O balance.
- Needs tobramycin trough drawn ___ AM.  Give tobramycin 
320mg IV x 1 when trough is <1.0.
- Continue vancomycin until ___ for MRSA bacteremia.  
Should have trough measured intermittently to assess for 
appropriate dosing.
- Needs 2 more days of cefepime treatment
- Continue ventilator weaning and trach collar trials if 
possible.  Diuresis should help with this.
- Please draw weekly labs: CBC/diff, chem-7, LFTs and fax to 
Infectious disease R.Ns. at ___.  All questions 
regarding outpatient antibiotics should be directed to the 
infectious disease R.Ns. at ___ or to on call MD in 
when clinic is closed

History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:  Mr. ___ is an ___ male with 
history of CAD s/p stenting, CHF (EF 55%), Afib, prior cardiac 
arrest and heart block s/p pacer/AICD placement, chronic trach, 
and recent MRSA bacteremia on vancomycin who presents from rehab 
with a one day history of fevers and vomiting, as well as AMS.  
Patient has had several recent admissions, including admission 
from ___ for PNA and MRSA bacteremia/sepsis.  Was 
discharged to rehab on vanco, readmitted ___ for hematuria 
and GI bleed (blood in ostomy bag), and again readmitted 
___ with persistent fevers and positive MRSA blood 
cultures.  Source of MRSA bacteremia was unclear, and work-up 
during that time included TTE/TEE negative for vegetations on 
valves and cardiac pacer leads, and negative tagged WBC scan.  
PICC was removed and replaced.  Patient discharged on planned 6 
week course of vanco through ___.  Hospital course also 
notable for pseudomonas and klebsiella UTI, treated with 7 day 
courses of cefepime and tobramycin.  Patient had Foley changed 
during that admission.  Was discharged back to ___ 
___.  
.
Since discharge, has been noted to have worsening renal function 
requiring nephrology consult, and in this setting his diuretic 
regimen was held.  Also had increasing SOB requiring pulmonary 
consult, with change in vent settings from pressure support to 
AC mode.  Has had recurrent GI bleed requiring transfusion of 2 
units pRBCs on ___, and has been continued on PPI, 
sucralfate, and iron supplementation.  Per report, usually 
responds to wife, but was less responsive over past ___ days.  
On day of admission had several episodes of vomiting, and per 
wife was febrile to 101.  Sent to ED for further evaluation. 
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.2 69 106/51 20 95% assist 
control.  Labs notable for leukocytosis (WBC 14.2) with 
neutrophil predominance, Hct 26.3 (stable), Na 127, Cr 3.5 
(baseline 1.4), lactate 1.2.  UA suggestive of recurrent UTI.  
CXR showed moderate pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural 
effusions, and was similar to recent prior studies.  Given LUE 
edema, ultrasound obtained which was negative for DVT.  Patient 
received vancomycin and cefepime.  Also got ASA given elevated 
trop of 0.2.  ECG showed paced rhythm.  Patient had 1L NS hung 
prior to transfer.  VS prior to transfer 100.0 70, 112/82, 15, 
99%.  
.  
On arrival to the MICU, patient nods yes when asked if he is in 
pain, but he cannot localize the pain.  Appears comfortable when 
resting in bed, though uncomfortable when examined.

   URINE CULTURE (Final ___: 
      YEAST.    10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.. 

___ RUQ US
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver is normal in 
echotexture without focal lesions. There is no intrahepatic or 
extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The normal CBD measures 
5 mm in diameter. Again noted is a large gallstone, measuring 
2.7 cm, in the non-fully distended gallbladder. The gallbladder 
wall is mildly thickened measuring up to 5 mm, nonspecific. 
There is normal hepatopetal portal venous flow. The enlarged 
spleen measures up to 16.6 cm. The visualized IVC, aorta and 
pancreas are grossly unremarkable.  Trace ascites is noted.  
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Known cholelithiasis. 
2. Mildly thickened gallbladder wall, unchanged and 
non-specific, could be 
seen in right heart failure, hypoalbuminemia or other liver 
disease. No 
ultrasound findings to suggest acute cholecystitis. 
3. Splenomegaly. 

___ LUE US
IMPRESSION: No DVT left upper extremity with a left basilic PICC 
in place.

___ G-tube check
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the percutaneous 
gastrostomy tube with bleeding and leakage throughout the tube.  
AP radiograph of the abdomen after injection of contrast 
material through the percutaneous gastrostomy is noted. The 
contrast material is demonstrated in the stomach as well as in 
the duodenum and jejunum. No definitive evidence of 
extravasation is noted. If clinically warranted, correlation 
with cross-sectional imaging might be considered.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with extensive cardiac PMH, recent MRSA bacteremia, 
trach on chronic mechanical ventilation, and chronic foley 
catheter with recent pseudomonal/klebsiella UTI, who presents 
now from rehab with fever, leukocytosis, vomiting, and AMS in 
setting enterococcus and yeast UTI, ___, MRSA bacteremia, 
hematochezia, and Stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer.
.
ACUTE ISSUES
#. MRSA Bacteremia:  Pt had recurrent MRSA bacteremia in the 
settting of vancomycin treatment.  We are particularly concerned 
about endocarditis from ICD given the refractory nature.  
However, removal of instrumentation is not an option per patietn 
and family wishes.  Source of infection include sacral 
decubitous ulcer, UTI, ventilation.  Pt does not have 
leukocytosis or fever.  Chronic colonization likely.  Complete 
bacterial clearance is unlikely in this setting.  
OUTPATIENT ISSUES
- START Daptomycin indefinitely
- PICC line in place, routine care
.
#. GIB: Pt presented with HCT drop and Bright red blood through 
ostomy.  He received a total of 3 units pRBC blood transfusion. 
We temporarily stopped tube feeding the setting of GIB, and 
discontinued his aspirin.  His HCT has been stable in the past 
48 hours without transfusion.  GI has been consulted, and did 
not feel that the benefit of osteostomy-scope outweighs its 
risk.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES
- CONTINUE tube feeding as scheduled
- STOP aspirin and anti-platelets forever. 
- START pantoprazole 40 mg iv bid
- CONTINUE ferrous sulfate, sucrafate
.
#. ___: Pt presented with elevated Cr to 3.5 on admission with 
anuria.  There was muddy brown cast on urine sedimentation, 
concerning for ATN in the setting of sepsis and tobramycin 
exposure.  We gave him gentle fluid challenge, and his urine 
output recovered shortly afterwards.  His creatinine decreased 
to 2.7 on the day of discharge.  This may or may not ever go 
back down to his previous baseline.  Regardless, he's not anuric 
and patient and family have refused initiation of dialysis.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES
- AVOID nephrotoxic medication
- DISCONTINUE Lisinopril
.
#. Hematuria and UTI:  Pt has indwelling foley catheter and 
presented with hematuria and positive UA.  Urine culture was 
notable for VRE, fungus.  We treated him with meropenem and 
fluconazole while he was in the MICU.  He received bladder 
irrigation for hematuria.  His hematuria resolved on the day of 
discharge.  Pt was asymptomatic from his UTI.  We felt it is 
impossible to completely treat his UTI.  We decided to 
withdrawal treatment for now to minimize the hepatic and renal 
drug intoxication.
.
#. Decubitus ulcer: Pt has a Stage 4 decubitus ulcer over sacrum 
and left thigh.  The pain from decubitous ulcer is his major 
concern while he was here.  He was seen by wound care.  They 
advise supportive care.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES
- Pleae CHANGE BODY POSITION every 2 hours
- Please provide adequate pain management with lidocaine patch, 
fentanyl, oxycodone.
.
#. Positive sputum culture: Pt has trach tube.  His sputum 
culture grew multiresistant klebsiella and pseudomonas.  Pt 
remained afebrile, no leukocytosis, left shift or increased 
sputum production.  We felt the complete irradiation was unlikey 
given his current clinical status and suspect he has permanent 
colonization.
.  
CHRONIC ISSUES
#. Chronic dCHF: Pt has diastolic CHF.  We continued his 
beta-blocker for the need of rate control.  We held his 
lisinopril in an hope of protecting his current kidney function. 
 We held his aspirin in the setting of GI bleeding.  We felt 
that active treatment for his CHF is less of a priority.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES
- DISCONTINUED Aspirin and all antiplatelet drugs
- DISCONTINUED Lisinopril
.
#. Atrial fibrillation: Pt is AV paced on telemetry. Not on 
anticoagulation given history of GI bleeding.  Rate controlled 
with carvedilol.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES
- Per our EP recommendation, they can disable the defibrillator 
function, while still keep AV pacing, if there is a need in the 
change of goal of care.  
.
# Depression: Continue citalopram.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
Pt declared a code status of DNR/DNI.  Extensive discussion has 
occurred between family and care provider team on goal of care.  
In general, our understanding is that family would like 
continued conservative treatment, with no invasive procedure, 
including the use of pressors.  We have conveyed clearly to the 
family that clinical improvement is unlikely in the current 
situation.  Pt's family expressed concerns that patient has not 
been getting enough comfort care (ie skin, wound, pain).
.
The wife has expressed continued frustration with being 
transferred back and forth from rehab to the hospital.  We 
assured her that the care provided to him at rehab is very good. 
 In general, we'd try to limit the number of unecessary 
hospitalizations.  We explained to the family, with the son 
present in the room, that the patient's condition is stable, but 
ultimately is declining.  We explicity told them that things are 
probably as good as they'll ever be, and that in the future he 
will have a slow and steady decline.  We are limited in 
interventions that can be done here in hospital and have 
conveyed that to his family.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you in the intensive care unit. 
 As you know, the blood stream infection is probably chronic and 
it would basically be impossible to cure of you that.  We 
believe that your pacemaker is colonized with the bacteria, and 
it would be impossible to remove it.  You also have a urinary 
tract infection, and you were bleeding somewhere in your 
intestines.  Fortunately the bleeding stopped.  You also have a 
chronic heart failure, which you are aware.  Your kidney 
insufficiency may resolve, but it may not.  

You were also administered the flu vaccine while you were here.

facility with continued bacteremia and bleeding around G-tube 
site. 
.
Briefly patient was doing well until ___ when he suffered a 
fall that caused multiple fractures. He was hospitalized and 
intubated and subsequently trached. He was transferred to rehab 
where he spent a good deal of time with multiple readmissions 
for various infections and chronic GI Bleeds. In ___ was 
admitted to ___ for PNA and found to have MRSa bacteremia. Was 
dicharged on Vancomycin. Was readmitted later that month for a 
GI bleed. ___ was deferred ___ to family wishes and 
comorbidites. He was discharged again to ___. 
Surveilece cultures remained positive and he was readmitted for 
infectious work up. TTE, TEE and tagged WBC scan were all 
negative for ocult infectious source. On that admission he was 
diagnosed with concurrent Pseudomonas and Klebsiella UTI and 
treated with Meropenam. Given his persistent MRSA bacteremia he 
was switched from Vancomycin to daptomycin. 
.
Over the last several days he has been febrile with intermittent 
AMS. Blood cultures are persistently positive. Per notes form 
his PCP and discussions with the family, he is being admitted

UGIB. 
.
# Brief Hospital course: Patient was initially admitted for 
infectious w/u due to fevers, and was found to have MRSA 
bacteremia (chronic, likely ___ seeding of ICD), and 
Klebsiella/Pseudomonas UTI.  These were treated with IV 
vancomycin and meropenem.  He subsequently developed bleeding at 
his G-tube site as well as increased dark output from ostomy 
bag.  His hct trend was: 30 (___) -> 28 (___) -> 25 (___) 
-> 22 (___).  He was transfused 1 unit pRBC.  Hct ___ was 18 
and bleeding persisted.  GI and surgery were consulted.  He was 
given reglan, and started on ppi iv bid.  GI performed 3 EGDs 
that large amounts of blood and an ulcer with visible vessel 
around peg insertion site; An initial attempt at clipping the 
ulcer caused bright red blood, confirming that this was likely 
the cause of the patient's recent bleed. 10cc of epinephrine 
were injected around the ulcer. 2 clips were applied around the 
ulcer with hemostasis successfully achieved. The PEG was 
removed.  Because of his chronic MRSA bacteremia (thought likely 
___ ICD seeding), TPN was not an option and family felt that a 
feeding tube would cause him too much discomfort.  The 
palliative care team was consulted for assistance with the 
family's decision-making regarding goals of care.  The family 
ultimately felt that his current quality of life was not 
consistent with what he would have wanted based on remarks he 
had made in the past.  They elected to change his goals of care 
to comfort-measures only.  On HD#9 he passed away with family at 
bedside.  Family declined autopsy.

Chief Complaint:
Abnormal Stress Test, New AI
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with a hx of CAD (s/p DES to LAD in 
___ 
who presented today for a routine stress echo (ordered by his 
PCP) and was found to have evidence of inducible ischemia and 
severe aortic insuficiency. The patient was in his usual state 
of health prior to the stress test. He retired from his 
___ job of ___ years just 3 days ago. While on the 
treadmill the patient developed left shoulder pain (similar to 
previous anginal pains) and ST changes on EKG. Echocardiography 
revealed 4+ aortic regurgitation (patient was noted to be 1+ on 
last echo in ___. After getting off the treadmill the pain 
went away and he felt back to baseline. The patient has 
otherwise been asymptomatic. He exercises 3 times per week and 
will notice faint chest pain only with maximal exercise. He 
denies shortness of breath, PND, lower extremity edema and 
orthopnea. He has not noticed any fevers, chills, night sweats, 
or weight loss. 

After the stress test the patient was sent straight to the ED. 
In the ED he had an EKG which reportedly showed no ischemic 
changes. He had a CTA chest which was negative for aortic 
dissection. He was then admitted to the cardiology service for 
further management. 

Currently the patient is asymptomatic although he is 
considerably distressed by this new diagnosis. 
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS  
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of deep venous 
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, 
 cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent 
fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf 
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.  
 
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on 
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, 
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CTA chest ___
1. No dissection, acute aortic injury, or pulmonary embolism.
2. Dense aortic arch and coronary artery calcifications
3. 3-mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule (4:148). If there is 
high risk of cancer, f/u may be obtained at 12 months; 
otherwise, no f/u is necessary.
4. Numerous calcified pleural plaques. 
   
ETT (___) with ECHO:  
Anginal type symptoms with borderline ischemic EKG changes at a 
high cardiac demand and good functional capacity. Resting 
systolic hypertension with blunted hemodynamic response to 
physiologic stress. Echo report sent separately. Patient 
transferred to ED for further evaluation. Dr. ___. 
 
The patient exercised for 8 minutes 45 seconds according to a 
___ treadmill protocol ___ METS) reaching a peak heart rate 
of 129 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 158/56 mmHg. The test 
was stopped because of anginal pain and ST changes (see exercise 
report for details). This level of exercise represents an 
average/good exercise tolerance for age. In response to stress, 
the ECG showed ischemic ST changes in the setting of abnormal 
resting ECG (see exercise report for details). Resting systolic 
hypertension with blunted blood pressure response to stress. 
There was a blunted heart rate response to stress [beta 
blockade]. 
 
Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 105 bpm and a 
blood pressure of 158/68 mmHg. These demonstrated normal left 
ventricular cavity size and regional/global systolic function. 
Right ventricular free wall motion is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion. The ascending aorta diameter is normal. No 
dissection flap is suggested by 2D or color flow Doppler (does 
not exclude). Doppler demonstrated severe aortic regurgitation 
and mild mitral regurgitation with no aortic stenosis or 
significant resting LVOT gradient. 
Echo images were acquired within 58 seconds after peak stress at 
heart rates of 125 - 112 bpm. These demonstrated appropriate 
augmentation of all segments. 
 
IMPRESSION: Good functional exercise capacity. Borderline 
ischemic ST changes with 2D echocardiographic evidence of severe 
resting aortic regurgitation and no inducible wall motion 
abnormalities. Blunted heart rate and blood pressure response to 
exercise. Severe aortic regurgitation at rest. Mild mitral 
regurgitation at rest. 
If clinically indicated, a thoracic CT/MR or TEE is suggested to 
evaluate for possible aortic dissection. A TEE would be best 
able to assess the aortic valve for possible vegetations.  

TTE ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity 
size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is 
mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Moderate to 
severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
findings are similar.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
========================================
Mr. ___ is a ___ with a hx of CAD (s/p DES to LAD in 
___ who presented for a routine stress echo and was found to 
have evidence of inducible ischemia and aortic insuficiency. 
  
ACTIVE ISSUES:
=======================
#) Aortic Insufficiency: Unclear etiology. Dissection was ruled 
out by CTA. There was no root dilation seen on TTE so more 
likely it is valvular in origin. Patient had no clinical signs 
of endocarditis and blood cultures had no growth to date. Most 
likely this is not acute AI given absence of symptoms other than 
during stress test. It is unclear how long it has been 
progressing for however. As for chronic etiologies, patient does 
not have a marfanoid habitus. He did however have a spontaneous 
subarachnoid hemorrhage which may or may not be related. RPR was 
negative. He did have mantle field radiation for Hodgkins in the 
1970s that could theoretically have contributed. On repeat 
echocardiogram patient did not have LV dilatation and EF was 
>60%. Clinically he did not have any signs of heart failure. 
- Since the patient is asymptomatic and appears to be 
compensated there was no urgent need for surgical evaluation. 
The patient was therefore scheduled to follow-up with his 
cardiologist, Dr. ___ to pursue further workup as an 
outpatient. 
- He was started on lisinopril for afterload reduction and 
diltiazem was stopped
  
#) Positive Stress Test/Hx of CAD: Patient had reversible EKG 
changes and anginal symptoms while on treadmill. He is known to 
have coronary artery disease which may have progressed. However 
it may be that he had demand ischemia from his aortic 
insufficiency that was further compounding the problem. There 
were no inducible wall motion abnormalities to suggest a 
significant functional problem. Since the stress test was 
performed for stable angina there is no evidence that PCI would 
have any benefit over medical therapy. Therefore he was 
discharged to follow-up with his cardiologist Dr. ___ 
further evaluation.  
- Could consider left heart cath as outpatient if patient has 
ischemic symptoms or is being evaluated for AVR
- Patient had difficulty tolerating statins because of myalgias 
therefore he will continue Niacin and Omega 3 fatty acids. LDL 
was 145 which is significantly above goal of 70. More aggressive 
LDL control should be discussed at outpatient follow-up with his 
cardiologist. 
- Patient reports that he is not on beta blocker because of 
fatigue
- Continued ASA/Plavix 
  
CHRONIC ISSUES:
===================
#) Asthma: well controlled
- Continued budenoside    
 
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
========================
# Patient will follow-up with his cardiologist Dr. ___ 
further workup of his new Aortic Insufficiency, to discuss his 
stress test, and to discuss more aggressive LDL lowering
# CODE STATUS- DNR, Okay to intubate for procedures but would 
not want prolonged intubation.   
# EMERGENCY CONTACT- Ex wife (HCP) ___ ___

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with HTN who presents with 
seizure. Around ___ on ___, daughter received a text from her 
cousin that the patient was vomiting. The patien't daughter then 
got back from work in the morning of ___ when she found her 
mother sleeping on her R side facing opposite direction. She 
then did a full turn out of bed and fell on the floor face 
first. Per the daughter, the patient had positive head strike on 
the night stand on her way down to the floor. Daughter turned 
her over and saw pt's bottom jaw retracted and top part of mouth 
sticking out, eyes open, arms straight out stiffly. Tongue was 
starting to come out, and pt was ""banging up against the bed."" 
After ___ min, convulsions stopped, and pt developed heavy 
breathing/snoring. Her eyes kind of cracked open but she was not 
responsive to daughter. EMS came and brought her outside, but 
head was flopping around as they were transporting her. When 
they got close to ___, pt started to ""come to"" and kept 
taking off the O2 mask. Seemed to go ""in and out"" of 
consciousness per daughter. She would get intermittently 
agitated, pupils were dilated, and she would have episodes of 
intermittent staring where she did not seem to be registering 
things. No further shaking. Reportedly got 2mg IV Ativan at 
___ and transferred to ___. Once she arrived at ___, the 
patient was complaining of abdominal pain. CT abd/pelvis showed 
acute pancreatitis. Patient was then intubated given her 
agitation and need for diagnostic procedures. LP was completed. 
Nicardipine gtt was initated at OSH for SBP >220. She is now 
admitted to the neuro ICU, remains intubated on nicardipine gtt 
for further workup and management.

Of note, about 1mo ago, pt was sitting with daughter's cousin. 
There was a yell, so daughter went to go find her mother. At 
that time, pt was sitting up with a ""deer caught in headlights 
look."" Cousin who witnessed the episode said that she sat 
upright, then started falling backwards and became stiff. Was 
shaking. Lasted a few seconds, then came out of it. After the 
episode, she said she was thirsty and did not remember the 
episode happening at all. 
 
Per son at bedside, she did have a seizure ___ years ago without 
any clear cause. She was living in ___ alone at that time. 
She was taking a lot of Klonopin, vicodin, and Percocet along 
with antidepressants, so unclear if this was a trigger. He does 
not know any further information about the seizure. Also unclear 
if she ever had strokes before. She had fallen ___ months ago in 
___, but son does not think she had any brain hemorrhages 
from that. She came back to ___ about 5 months ago to live 
with her daughter. Since that time, she has only been taking 
lisinopril. No other pain medications.  Patient's daughter 
denies any further drug use over the past 5 months.

IMAGING/STUDIES
CT A/P: ___- 1. Mild to moderate intra and extrahepatic 
biliary ductal dilatation with
probable calculus in the distal common bile duct indicative of 
choledocholithiasis.  If needed, MRCP can provide further 
confirmation and assessment.
2. Edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fat stranding and 
fluid most suggestive of acute interstitial edematous 
pancreatitis.  In the setting of probable choledocholithiasis, 
constellation of findings likely indicate gallstone 
pancreatitis.  Correlation with serum amylase and lipase levels 
are
recommended.
3. Cholelithiasis.  Pericholecystic fluid and stranding may be 
secondary to pancreatitis.
4. Extensive atherosclerotic disease with severe stenosis of the 
SMA and right renal artery with resultant atrophy of the right 
kidney.
5. Bilateral nodular adrenal glands which are incompletely 
characterized.
6. 0.5 cm pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe.  Please see 
recommendations section.

MRI Brain w/ and w/o: ___: 1. Motion limited exam.
2. No evidence for acute infarction.
3. Nonmasslike FLAIR signal abnormality within the right 
posteriorperiventricular white matter, with discontiguous foci 
of cystic encephalomalacia and no evidence for blood products.  
These may represent sequela of prior infarction, demyelination, 
infection, or other insult.
4. Small chronic infarcts in the left cerebellar hemisphere. 
Punctate cortical FLAIR hyperintensity in the right frontal lobe 
may also represent a chronic infarct.
5. Small area of FLAIR hyperintensity and contrast enhancement 
in the right occipital cortex, with associated chronic blood 
products, and with questionable involvement of the adjacent 
sulci.  This may represent a chronic infarct with hemorrhagic 
transformation or sequela of amyloid angiopathy.
6. Small chronic microhemorrhage in the right posterior internal 
capsule, most likely hypertensive.
7. 6 mm round structure in the region of the left petroclival 
confluence, with diagnostic considerations including a 
cholesterol granuloma, another type of lesion, or an aberrant 
blood vessel.  Partial left mastoid air cell opacification.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
================
PATIENT SUMMARY:
================
___ year old woman who presented with generalized tonic-clonic 
seizure in the setting of gallstone pancreatitis who was found 
to have right side renal artery stenosis. Seizures were 
controlled with keppra and patient underwent cholecystectomy and 
patients blood pressure was well controlled with medical 
management.

=============
ACUTE ISSUES:
=============

#Generalized tonic clonic seizures: 
Patient presented after a witnessed generalized tonic-clonic 
seizures. She presented to the emergency room and seizures were 
initially controlled with ativan in the emergency room. 
Neurology followed the patient during this hospitalization for 
workup of seizures. Patient was found to have gallstone induced 
pancreatitis which is believed to have caused seizures in a 
patient with underlying susceptibility given history of CVA. She 
underwent cholecystectomy. Infectious workup was negative. LP 
was preformed which was bland. MRI demonstrated existing 
infarcts, but no evidence of acute infarction or intracranial 
process. The patient was maintained on Keppra 1500 BID and had 
no further seizures during hospitalization. Neurology recommends 
that the patient continue keppra 1500 BID indefinitely until 
potential modification by outpatient neurology in 6 months. If 
there is concern for mild encephalopathy and gait unsteadiness, 
Keppra could be decreased to 1250 mg twice daily prior to 
follow-up. She was started on atorvastatin and aspirin for 
primary prevention of CVA. 

#Renal artery stenosis:
Patient was found to have right sided renal artery stenosis on 
CT during hospitalization. Systolic blood pressure were 
initially 170 systolic. Her blood pressure was controlled with 
nicardipine drip. Vascular surgery evaluated the patient and 
recommended no surgical intervention. She was medically managed 
with oral antihypertensive regime and blood pressure was 
successfully controlled to the 100-160s systolic. she should 
continue lisinopril, amlodapine and labetalol as an outpatient.

#Gallstone pancreatitis 
Patient was found to have choledocolithiasis induced 
pancreatitis. She underwent cholecystectomy and had an 
uneventful postoperative course. Pain was well controlled with 
oral oxycodone in the postoperative period. The patient will 
follow with acute care surgery two weeks after discharge.

DISCHARGE WORKSHEET INSTRUCTIONS:

Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___!

WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED?
You were admitted to the hospital because you had seizures.

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?
Your seizures were controlled with medication. You were found to 
have abdominal pain caused by inflammation in your gallbladder 
and pancreas. Your gallbladder was removed and this helped the 
inflammation. We think that your seizures were caused  by the 
inflammation in your gallbladder and pancreas. You were also 
found to have hypertension caused by a partial blockage to the 
artery for your right kidney. You were started on new 
medications to treat your blood pressure and your blood pressure 
improved.

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO AT HOME?
You should continue the new medications for your seizures and 
blood pressure and follow up with the surgeons and neurologist 
at your next scheduled appointment. You also have a primary care 
physician appointment scheduled for you to follow up and 
establish care. You will have to discuss with the new PCP about 
cardiologist referral for your peripheral vascular disease that 
was treated with aspirin, Plavix, and procedures in your lower 
extremity arteries in ___ last year. As you know, your 
Plavix was stopped due to GI bleeding that occurred in ___ 
last year. You need a new cardiologist to continue to manage 
your antiplatelet agents.

Because you had a seizure, please do not drive a car until you 
are cleared by your Neurologist. 

Please work on switching your insurance to ___ so that 
you can continue to get care here. 

Thank you for allowing us be involved in your care, we wish you 
all the best!

Your ___ Team

(sounds like distal upper AVM), recent hospitalization for
seizures in the setting of gallstone pancreatitis status post
cholecystectomy who was discharged on ___ who presents to
the hospital with several days of weakness.  She reports that
initially following discharge she was feeling well.  She reports
that after several days at home she started to feel increasingly
fatigued.  She reports that she felt similar to when she was
bleeding in ___ and required the upper GI which found a
likely AVM.  She reports the records from that hospitalization 
or
at ___ in ___.  She reports that at that 
time
her bowel movements were normal.  She reports that on the 
evening
prior to admission she developed diarrhea with black stools.  
She
reports that this is the exact same happened last time she had
the upper GI bleed.  She reports that she continue to feel
further fatigue.  She touch base with her primary care doctor 
who
referred her into the emergency department for further
evaluation.  She also reports that while at home she had a
decreased appetite.  Per her daughter she started to look
increasingly pale.  She became lightheaded and dizzy in the
shower on several occasions.  She also reports that she had
urinary symptoms from around the time she got home.  She reports
that over the last 6 days she has had increased lower abdominal
pain, burning on urination, pressure.  She reports that she 
feels
like it got so bad she decreased her p.o. intake to reduce the
amount that she would have to urinate.  She also reports that 
she
had some blood in the urine.

In the emergency department she was seen and evaluated.  Her
initial vital signs were unremarkable.  She was afebrile with a
heart rate of 81, blood pressure 157/94, respiratory rate of 18. 

Her H&H was notable for 11.3/35.3 which is up from her discharge
hemoglobin and hematocrit of 8.7/26.8.  She had a UA that was
checked which unfortunately contained 9 epithelial cells.  It 
did
have positive nitrates, large leukocyte esterase, greater than
184 white blood cells as well as few bacteria.  She received 1 g
of IV ceftriaxone, 2 L of normal saline, and was admitted to the
medical service for further evaluation and management.  She was
also evaluated by the surgery service while in the emergency
department he felt like if she had anything was likely a slow GI
bleed and would not require acute surgical intervention and 
would
recommend admission to medicine for a GI workup.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were seen at ___ for gastrointestinal bleed.  You 
underwent an endoscopic procedure that showed a small blood 
vessel abnormality in your stomach.  We suspected that a similar 
abnormality in your small bowel could be the cause of your 
bleed.  We tried to verify this with the capsule endoscopy, 
however the images were of poor quality.  You may need to have 
this capsule study repeated as an outpatient.  You may require 
further transfusions in the future.

You also had some burning pain in her lower abdomen that was 
likely due to a urinary tract infection.  You were treated with 
antibiotics for this.

Your initial blood cultures showed growth of some bacteria.  
Given that you did not have symptoms of a bloodstream infection, 
it is likely that these were a contaminant.  You were treated 
with antibiotics while we waited for these bacterial colonies to 
grow enough to be identified as contaminants from your skin. 

Please take all your medications as prescribed and follow-up at 
your outpatient appointments.

It was a pleasure taking care of you,

Your ___ team

possibly in the sigmoid colon. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history of CVA, seizures, upper GI AVM's with chronic 
anemia, HTN, peripheral vasculopathy, who presented after 
presyncopal fall.  

ACUTE ISSUES 
============
# Acute on Chronic Blood Loss Anemia 
# Upper GI Bleed
Presented with ongoing intermittent melena and known gastric and 
duodenal AVMs per prior EGD's s/p single balloon enteroscopy 
with APC to small bowel AVMs. Stool guaiac positive in ___. 
Required 2u pRBCs during her hospitalization. EGD showed several 
duodenal/gastric AVMs that were cauterized, as well as likely 
___ esophagus. Patient was iron deficient and was given 2 
125mg IV infusions of ferric  gluconate. Patient was continued 
on PPI prophylaxis.

# Seizures
Patient reported that her last seizure 1 week prior to admission 
and involved extremity shaking and AMS that lasted several 
minutes, consistent with previous episodes. Neurology was 
consulted for optimization of her AEDs. EEG was performed and 
the patient was continued on Keppra with plans for outpatient 
followup in neurology clinic. She had no seizures in house.

# Severe, Bilateral Carotid Artery Stenosis
Carotid US done as part of pre-syncope work-up revealed severe 
bilateral carotid artery stenosis (80-99%). She was seen by 
vascular surgery in house, who recommended no urgent treatment. 
This could certainly contribute to pre-syncope, however vascular 
surgery will followup with patient for CEA consideration. 

# Presyncope
Presented 4 days after presyncopal episode at home with fall and 
head trauma. CT head and c-spine were negative at OSH. Signs and 
symptoms not consistent with prior seizures. Initial ddx 
included CNS process (TIA, carotid stenosis), cardiac (had old 
RBBB on EKG, and new LBBB on this admission), orthostasis (had 
previously documented orthostatic hypotension), vasovagal event, 
peripheral vertigo (has tinnitus), or symptomatic anemia. 

# Concern for Cardiac Conduction Disease
Noted patient has HRs usually in ___, even when standing and 
lightheaded. There was concern that she was not adequately 
augmenting her cardiac output with exertion due to conduction 
disease and this blunted response was contributing to her 
pre-syncope. Also noted to initially have RBBB on EKG, but then 
LBBB on EKG done later in the same day (in ___ on presentation). 
Unusual and concerning for conduction disease, so cardiology was 
consulted and beta-blocker (home med) was held. pMIBI revealed 
no overt ischemia and ambulatory telemetry revealed that 
patients heart rates increased to ___. Cardiology felt that this 
was an appropriate response and the patient did not require 
further electrophysiologic evaluation during this 
hospitalization.

# Hypertension
Patient has history of hypertension (renal artery stenosis) with 
orthostatic hypotension. Antihypertensives were held in the 
setting of GI bleed but were restarted once her GI bleed was 
addressed. She was continued on home doses of blood pressure 
medications and was also started on chlorthalidone 12.5mg daily 
for better control.   

# Chronic Back and Neck Pain
Has narcotics contract w PCP for oxycodone 5mg BID since 
___. Review of MassPMP indicates pt also prescribed 
vicodin in OSH ___ three days prior to presentation. Likely that 
pain is exacerbated by recent fall, so increased pain regimen 
while in-house. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
# Neuropathic pain: continued gabapentin 300mg TID. 
# GERD: continued PPI and famotidine. 
# Chronic nausea: continued ondansetron PRN. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[]Ensure passage of capsule, on discharge KUB ___ noted to be 
in sigmoid colon/rectum. Consider repeat KUB to assess if 
concerned. Per GI, very unlikely to cause obstruction once in 
colon.
[]Labetalol/Beta-Blockade: Recommend avoiding all beta-blockade 
given heart rates in the ___. Patient's labetalol was 
discontinued to avoid negative chronotrope effect
[]Chlorthalidone: titrate dose as needed for adequate blood 
pressure control
[]ASA 81: discharged on ASA 81 given stroke risk in the setting 
of severe carotid disease, if GI bleed recurs, risk/benefit 
should be discussed with patient (okay to hold per inpatient 
cardiology recommendations but neurology would recommend 
continuing)
[]Atorvastatin: increased to 80mg (although less data in 
secondary prevention) due to severe vascular disease
___ esophagus: Noted on EGD. Will have follow up 
endoscopy with plan for biopsy in ___  
[]Labs: Repeat CBC at clinic visit to ensure stability, 
discharge Hgb 9.9
[]Vascular Followup: Has appointment with Dr. ___ ___ for 
CEA evaluation
[]Neurology Followup: Has appointment for further management of 
anti-seizure medications

IMAGING
==================

___ MRI Head 
Diffusion abnormalities along the cortex of both cerebral 
hemispheres predominantly in the parieto-occipital lobes are 
suggestive of early ischemic brain injury. 

___ LENIs 
1.  Limited examination, but no evidence of deep vein thrombosis 
in the right upper extremity. 
2.  Probable hematoma in the upper inner arm as described.  
Correlate with 
physical examination for chronicity, and advise clinical 
follow-up to ensure resolution over time. 

___ TTE 
The left atrial volume index is normal. Normal left ventricular 
wall thickness, cavity size, and regional/global systolic 
function (biplane LVEF = 64 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests 
a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved 
regional and global biventricular systolic function. No valvular 
pathology or pathologic flow identified. No pericardial 
effusion. 

___ EEG 
This is an abnormal ICU continuous video EEG monitoring study 
due to the presence of a burst suppression pattern, indicative 
of a severe ecphalopathy. By the late afternoon, overall 
amplitudes began to diminish, and more prolonged background 
attenuation was seen, with plentiful artifact. By the end of the 
recording, definitive activity of cerebral origin was not 
clearly seen. These findings are indicative of worsening of the 
severe encephalopathy, which could be related to medication 
effects, toxic/metabolic disturbances or progression of 
neurologic injury. There were no clear epileptiform discharges 
or electrographic seizures in this recording. 

___ Shoulder ___ views 
Displaced humeral head fracture corresponding to given history, 
with exact relation of fracture fragments difficult to identify 
given limited included two views. 

___ CXR 
AP portable supine view of the chest.  The endotracheal tube is 
positioned with its tip 3.8 cm above the carina.  There is a 
vague opacity in the right lower lung which could reflect a 
focus of pneumonia though attention on followup advised.  There 
is mild retrocardiac opacity likely atelectasis.  No large 
effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal 
silhouette appears grossly unremarkable.  There is a 
dextroscoliotic curvature of the thoracic spine.  No acute bony 
abnormalities. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ was admitted to the MICU at ___ for post-cardiac 
arrest management. He received 5 rounds of CPR prior to ROSC. 
Unfortunately, despite obtaining ROSC, he suffered a devastating 
brain injury likely ___ anoxia. This was confirmed on MRI as 
well as with consult from the neurology team. After speaking 
with his HCP, we agreed to progress to CMO. He was extubated and 
expired on ___.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ year old female with a history of GERD and 
prior C.diff infecion ___ years ago who presents with right lower 
quadrant abdominal pain.
.
She reports that the pain started when she awoke this morning. 
It is localized to the mid abdomen with radiation to the RLQ. 
She had some associated nausea without vomiting. The abdominal 
pain very similar to the pain with her previous C.diff colitis. 
She presented to her ___ clinic, where there was concern for 
appendicitis. She was also given Acetaminophen 975 mg PO.
.
After arriving in the ED, she began to have diarrhea, about ___ 
episodes. The pain was briefly relieved with defecation. She was 
incontinent of stool at times. There was no bright red blood per 
rectum or melena. She has felt slightly feverish, but did not 
check her temperature. Her appetite has been poor today. She 
denies any vaginal bleeding or discharge.
.
Prior to this morning, she was feeling at her baseline without 
any symptoms. She denies any recent antibiotics. Last week, she 
was on a cruise to ___. She did not have any diarrhea or GI 
symptoms on the trip. She did not drink any unbottled water or 
local food.
.
Initial vitals in ED triage were T 99.7, HR 110, BP 145/84, RR 
16, and SpO2 98% on RA. Exam was notable to RLQ tenderness. 
Pelvic exam showed no CMT or adnexal tenderness. Her CBC was 
notable for WBC 17.6 with N 86.4%. Her chemistry panel showed Cr 
0.7, K 3.4, bicarb 21, and anion gap 14. LFTs were unremarkable 
except for Lipase 61. UCG was negative and UA appeared 
contaminated with WBC 6 and few bacteria, but Epi 18. CT 
abd/pelvis showed several loops of small bowel in the right 
lower quadrant and pelvis with wall edema, minimal surrounding 
fat stranding, and trace free fluid. The appendix was minimally 
hyperemic but only 5-6 mm in diameter, and unlikely to represent 
acute appendicitis.
.
She was given NS ___ ml IV. Stool samples were sent for C.diff 
and bacterial culture. Antibiotics were held pending culture 
results. She received Morphine x3 and Dilaudid 0.5 mg IV x2. She 
continued to have abdominal pain and was admitted to medicine 
for pain control and further workup of her enteritis.
.
Vitals prior to floor transfer were T 99.2, HR 89, BP 119/74, RR 
14, and SPO2 99% on RA. On reaching the floor, she reported 
continued abdominal pain in the periumbilical area with 
radiation to the RLQ. She reported baseline loose stool, but 
that the current diarrhea is abnormal for her.
.

IMAGING:

___ CT ABD/PELVIS:

IMPRESSION:
1.  Enteritis involving several loops of small bowel located in 
the right
lower quadrant of the abdomen and within the pelvis.  
Differential diagnosis
includes infectious, inflammatory, and ischemic etiology.
2.  The appendix is 5-6 mm in diameter, and given the diffuse 
inflammatory
findings, appendicitis is not likely the cause of the patient's 
symptoms.

___ CXR:
FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  No pleural effusions.  
No parenchymal
abnormalities.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ year old female with a history of GERD and 
prior C.diff infecion ___ years ago who presents with right lower 
quadrant abdominal pain and watery diarrhea.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

# Enteritis/Abdominal Pain: Most likely represents a viral 
enteritis given her associated URI symptoms of voice hoarseness 
and sinus congestion, though her recent cruise to ___ raises 
traveler's diarrhea as also possible but unlikely due to late 
presentation. Appendicitis was considered very unlikely based on 
imaging and prominence of diarrhea. Fortunately C-diff PCR is 
negative. Campylobacter and otther stool studies also negative. 
IBD very unlikely given the acute presentation and lack of alarm 
or systemic symptoms. She receivedI IV fluids, bismuth, and an 
empiric 3-day course of po ciprofloxacin. Her pain was managed 
with tylenol, opioids, and dicyclomine for cramping. She was 
tolerating a light diet prior to time of discharge.

# Leukocytosis: Resolved after IV fluids overnight after 
admission. She had elevated WBC 17.6 with N 86.4% on admission. 
Most likely this is multifactorial from enteritis along with 
hypovolemia and hemoconcentration. Resolved with fluids alone 
without any initial empiric antibiotic coverage.

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# GERD: She takes Omeprazole 40 mg PO BID for GERD symptoms. 
Given her Cdiff history, tapering her PPI as an outpatient would 
be reasonable to consider. Continued Omeprazole 40 mg PO BID for 
now

# Anxiety: Continued home fluoxetine.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- consider tapering omeprazole as outpatient  if able given 
history of c-diiff

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted after returning from ___, as she was 
still having severe hip pain with movement.  X-rays suggested no 
hardware malfunction.  The Orthopedics service was consulted, 
who evaluated the patient and recommended rehabilitation with 
physical therapy.  The patient was also noted to have anemia 
with a hematocrit drop to 27 from the mid-30s approximately 1.5 
months ago.  This was likely due to her fracture, as a hematoma 
was noted on the side of the hip without evidence of expansion 
during the hospitalization.  Her hematocrit remained stable. and 
was 25 at the time of discharge.

Additionally, she was found to have pyuria on urinalysis; 
however, the patient denied dysuria.  For this reason, 
antibiotic treatment was deferred, although this should continue 
to be followded as an outpatient.

with CAD, HTN, CHF, dyslipidemia, depression, panic attacks and 
renal cell carcinoma who is transfered to the ___ from ___ 
after having a osteolytic lession in T7-T8. Patient presented on 
___ with SOB and delirium from her nursing home. She was 
satting 80% on RA in the nursing home and CXR was compatible 
with CHF and possible PNA (film not available). She received 
levofloxacin 500 mg PO Daily without improvemt. On ___ a

She was admitted to the ICU and diuresed 5 L for possible CHF. 
She was weaned of the oxygen and had a respiratory alcalosis 
with metabolic alkalosis with a small A-a gradient, which was 
thought to be due to her COPD. Patient was also diagnosed with 
atrial fibrilation in this last hospitalization. It was made the 
decision to cotninue ASA & Plavix and not anticoagulate due to 
prior bad experiences with coumadin (unclear). She was diuresed 
and betablocked. IT was suggested to stard difoxin 50 mg BID and 
consider cardizem. BNP 1279.1

Imaging:
MRI of spine ___:
Multilevel cervical spondylotic changes are seen from C3 through 
C6. No definite metastatic lesion is seen in the cervical spine. 
Within the thoracic spine, there are metastatic lesions 
involving the posterior vertebral body and the posterior 
elements at T7 and T8. There is substantial epidural disease at 
T7 which encases and displaces the cord anteriorly with mild 
compression. There is no abnormal cord signal at this time. 
There is a metastatic lesion involving the T5 vertebral body on 
the right. Bilateral pleural effusions are seen. Evaluation of 
the lumbar spine demonstrates multilevel spondylosis. No 
definite metastatic lesions seen. Left kidney is not visualized 
and may have been surgically removed. Please clinically 
correlate.
IMPRESSION:
Metastatic disease at T5, T7 and T8. There is epidural tumor at 
T7 which encases the cord and causes mild cord compression.
 
TTE ___: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal 
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy. There is mild regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal inferior and 
infero-lateral akinesis (EF 55%). No masses or thrombi are seen 
in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate 
to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion.
 
MRI head/brain ___:  No evidence of metastatic disease in the 
brain. No acute cranial process is seen.
 
CT abd/pelvis ___ (prelim): No evidence of local disease 
recurrence or distant metastasis. large stool in the 
rectosigmoid region.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. AMS: Per discussion with daughter, patient has had 
progressive dementia for months, although daughter was not 
present to comment on deviation from baseline. Her superimposed 
delirium and agitation were likely from benzo withdrawal, as she 
was not initially continued on her outpatient standing lorazepam 
(med list wasn't yet available). With addition of this, and 1mg 
PO haldol at night, she continued to be confused, although was 
much more calm and had no further agitation. Her delirium was 
also managed with pain control (she had very little pain during 
the admission, though) and frequent reorientation and 
reassurance. Infectious workup was negative. She had a brain MRI 
to rule out CVA or metastatic disease, and this was negative.
 
2. Lytic spine lesion: Seen in T5, T7, T8. Also seen was a mass 
surrounding the spinal cord with mild anterior spinal cord 
compression, although with a normal neuro exam. She underwent 3 
sessions of XRT during this admission, and will continue XRT on 
___ and ___ at 2pm to complete a total of 5 sessions. It 
remains unclear if her lesions are metastatic renal carcinoma or 
a new primary, as her renal cell cancer was last treated ___ 
years ago. CT abdomen/pelvis was done to search for a primary, 
or find a site amenable to biopsy as XRT made vertebral biopsy 
not possible. Tumor markers were also sent, but not suggestive 
of a specific diagnosis. After discussion with the patient's 
daughter ___ (to whom the patient deferred all medical 
decisions due to her confusion), it was decided that no further 
workup for a primary site would be performed. Also, it was 
decided that there would be no further attempts at treating the 
patient's malignancy at this time. The patient was on 
dexamethasone, along with insulin sliding scale and bactrim for 
prophylaxis, during this admission. She was discharged on a 
dexamethasone taper, and the bactrim and insulin can be stopped 
once she is off steroids.  Please continue the taper through 
___ as outlined explicitly in her discharge medication list.  
Taper may be modified further upon follow up with 
radiation-oncology.
 
3. Disposition: The patient is to return to her prior skilled 
nursing facility. Her other multiple chronic medical problems 
remained stable and her prior medication regimen was continued. 
Regarding goals of care, the patient's daughter was clear that 
her mother would not want aggressive cancer treatments. She will 
complete her current radiation course and there is no plan for 
further treatment of her malignancy. However, she would be 
amenable to rehospitalization and reconsideration of treatment 
options if an acute problem were to develop. Patient's code 
status is DNR/DNI.

IMAGING:
========
CT ABD PLV w/oral Contrast  (___)

IMPRESSION: 
1.  Interval (since ___ placement of a colonic stent,
2.  Circumscribed 10.4 x 7.4mm anterior pelvic fluid collection 
containing small locules of gas, likely an abscess from sigmoid 
tumor perforation. This is amenable to drainage.
2a.  Moderate/large amount of free air, and small amount of free 
fluid within the peritoneum.
3. Extensive lymphadenopathy in the retroperitoneum and porta 
hepatis, which results in narrowing of the origin of the left 
renal vein. Encasement of the splenic vein-SMV confluence and 
bilateral renal arteries is also demonstrated, without 
significant intraluminal narrowing in these vessels.  Normally 
enhancing kidneys on today's study.
4. Innumerable hepatic metastases.
5. Innumerable pulmonary metastases, lungs only partially 
imaged.
6. Moderately-sized bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions.

___ Flexible sigmoidoscopy
A circumferential mass was encountered at the rectosigmoid 
junction around 15 cm from the anal verge highly suspcious for 
primary colorectal cancer. The colonoscope was unable to 
traverse the stricture which was estimated at around 9mm in 
diameter.The mass was very friable. (biopsy)
Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to distal sigmoid colon.

Sigmoidoscopy ___:
Contents: Solid green stool was found in the rectum. No fresh or 
old blood was noted.  A metal stent was found in the rectum. 
There is mild tumor ingrowth into the mid-portion of the stent. 
This area is friable with some bleeding from passage of the 
endoscope - likely source of bleeding.   
Impression: Stent in the rectum
Stool in the rectum
Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to splenic flexure 
Recommendations: Stool softners and laxatives as d/w inpatient 
team. 
Oral iron 

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION:    
There is no clear radiographic change over the past 11 days.  
Bilateral 
pleural effusions moderate on the right small on the left and 
callus pulmonary nodules are unchanged. Extent of central 
adenopathy is better revealed by the chest CT scan. 
  
Confluent opacification at the base of the right lung is 
probably atelectasis, pleural mild pneumonia is difficult to 
exclude.  In all other locations there no findings that would 
raise the possibility of pneumonia. 

___ ___:
FINDINGS:  
There is normal compressibility, flow and augmentation of the 
bilateral common femoral, proximal, mid, distal femoral, and 
popliteal veins. Normal color flow and compressibility are 
demonstrated in the posterior tibial and peroneal veins. There 
is normal respiratory variation in the common femoral veins 
bilaterally. No evidence of medial popliteal fossa (___) cyst. 

  
IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the bilaterallower 
extremity veins. 

EKG ___: 
Narrow complex tachycardia. Probably sinus tachycardia. Compared 
to the 
previous tracing of ___ the rate has increased. 

CXR ___:
FINDINGS:  
Numerous nodular opacities compatible the patient's metastatic 
disease are again appreciated. In addition, there is worsening 
pulmonary edema as well as a worsening right lower lobe 
infiltrate which could represent pneumonia in the correct 
clinical setting. A right pleural effusion is also increased in 
size. 
  
IMPRESSION:    
Worsening combination of pleural effusion, pulmonary edema and 
possibly 
pneumonia particularly in the right lower lobe. 

CTA CHEST W/ CONTRAST ___:
IMPRESSION:  
1. Partially limited evaluation of the subsegmental pulmonary 
arteries, 
however no evidence of central, lobar, or segmental pulmonary 
embolism.

innumerable pulmonary metastases, as well as enlargement of 
bilateral pleural effusions, large on the right and moderate on 
the left. 
3. Partially imaged upper abdomen demonstrates diffuse 
intrahepatic metastasis and considerable upper abdominal 
lymphadenopathy. 

KUB ___:
IMPRESSION:    
1.  Rectal stent overlying the sacrum. 
2. No bowel obstruction. 
3. Likely interval decrease of small right pleural effusion. 

CT ABDOMEN PELVIS W/ CONTRAST ___:
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Interval (since ___ placement of a colonic stent,

4. Innumerable hepatic metastases. 
5. Innumerable pulmonary metastases, lungs only partially 
imaged. 
6. Moderately-sized bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions 

PATHOLOGY:
==========
___ GI mucosa
PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:
Sigmoid mass biopsy: Adenocarcinoma, low grade

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was a ___ with history of HCV and EtOH abuse who 
presented with abdominal pain and melena with imaging concerning 
for metastatic colon cancer.  

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
# Metastatic colon cancer: Patient presented with weight loss 
for several months with anemia and abdominal pain. Patient 
without prior preventative health care. Imaging from outside 
hospital demonstrated rectosigmoid mass with metastases to the 
liver and lungs. Patient underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy with 
biopsy demonstrating adenocarcinoma. Given near complete 
obstruction Advanced Endoscopy placed a palliative stent. He 
developed diffuse abdominal pain on ___ CT abd showed 
colonic stent perforation. He was not deemed a surgical 
candidate due to his widely metastatic disease. He wished to 
become CMO/DNR/DNI, and expired peacefully on ___. Family 
was notified and declined autopsy. 

# Abdominal Stent Perforation: Experienced diffuse abdominal 
pain on ___, CT abdomen showed perforation ___ stent.  He was 
not felt to be a good surgical candidate due to metastatic 
cancer and poor functional status. He wished to become CMO. 
Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Metronidazole were prescribed to 
improve his abdominal pain and discomfort. 

# Hyponatremia, chronic: Patient presented with sodium of 118 at 
outside hospital The patient was given IV fluids until stable 
sodium level reached at 127. SIADH was thought to be a 
significant component of his hyponatremia, given his extensive 
metastatic disease to his lungs.

# Septicemia: Met sepsis criteria on ___. Thought to be due to 
either hospital-associated pneumonia or GI translocation in the 
setting of stent perforation. He was treated with antibiotics 
until his family was able to visit, then discontinued.

# Hospital-Associated Pneumonia: He developed increased sputum 
production and shortness of breath, and a chest x-ray was 
suggestive of right lower lobe pneumonia. He was treated with 
vancomycin and ceftriaxone.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============

# Microcytic anemia: Patient found to have anemia with MCV 79. 
Iron studies demonstrated anemia of chronic disease and also 
likely iron deficient in setting of chronic bleeding from GI 
malignancy. He was started on iron supplementation.

# Transaminitis: Likely secondary to metastatic liver 
involvement vs. EtOH use given elevated AST:ALT ratio.

# Alcohol abuse: Patient reports chronic use of alcohol, 
multiple beers and at least two shots of brandy daily. Has 
continued to drink despite lack of appetite prior to 
hospitalization. During his admission, he had no evidence of 
withdrawal.

# Melena: Patient had melena after stent placement. 
Sigmoidoscopy on ___ showed tumor infiltration into the stent 
with friable, bleeding tissue, which was the likely source of 
his bleeding.

# Hypertension: Held home lisinopril in the setting of low blood 
pressures.

# Hepatitis C: untreated.

Dear loved ones of Mr. ___,

It was as pleasure taking part in his care during your 
hospitalization at ___. He wastransferred from ___ 
___ after a CT scan was concerning for colon cancer. A 
biopsy revealed colon cancer with metastases to his liver and 
his lung. He had a stent placed in his colon to relieve his 
abdominal pain. He wasseen by the Oncologists who felt he was 
not a candidate for chemotherapy given his weakness/poor 
functional status. Over his hospitalization  he had pneumonia, 
which was treated with antibiotics. He developed worsening 
abdominal pain and was found to have a perforated colon from the 
stent that was placed. It was a pleasure taking part in his 
care!

mediastinal 
silhouettes are normal. There is minimal right CP angle blunting 
compatible with either a tiny effusion or is small amount of 
pleural thickening the bony thorax appears normal   IMPRESSION:  
Blunting of the right CP angle otherwise normal chest.  

___  Barium Esophagram
The patient is status post ___ fundoplication with surgical 
clips in the left upper abdomen on the initial scout view. The 
distal esophagus is not dilated and appears unremarkable. Barium 
is seen passing freely from the distal esophagus through the 
gastroesophageal junction into the stomach without evidence of 
hold up or leak.
IMPRESSION: Normal appearance of the ___ fundoplication 
without evidence of holdup or leak.

___  LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US
Normal abdominal ultrasound.

___ 08:03AM BLOOD tTG-IgA-___ h/o chronic abdominal ___ attributed to IBS, GERD s/p 
___ fundoplication in ___ admitted to ___ 
service with abdominal ___ and found to have no acute surgical 
issue. He was then transferred to medicine for continued ___ 
and inability to tolerate PO. 

# Acute on chronic abdominal ___: Pt reported intermittent RUQ 
___ distinct from his typical LLQ IBS ___. Unclear etiology, 
but extensive workup at OSH and ___ including LFTs, lipase, 
CBC, TTG IgA, EGD, CT abd, HIDA scan, barium swallow, CXR and 
RUQ u/s negative.   No recent trauma or chest wall tenderness to 
suggest MSK etiology. Symptoms may be due to IBS but given 
inconsistencies in patient's description of symptoms from day to 
day and specific requests for exploratory surgery and narcotic 
___ medications, there is concern for factitious disorder vs 
malingering. Discontinued IV dilaudid that was started on 
admission given lack of clear etiology of ___ beyond known IBS 
and lack of IV med requirement (pt tolerating pills). 
Transitioned to PO tramadol PRN and resumed home ___ regimen 
___. Psychiatry was consulted and felt that patient would 
benefit from longitudinal outpatient therapy. He was observed 
and eventually ___ resolved and he was able to tolerate a 
regular diet. He was discharged with plan for close follow up 
with PCP and his outpatient ___ specialist.

# Epigastric discomfort: Reported intermittent epigastric 
burning. OSH EGD negative, normal post surgical changes s/p 
Nissen on barium swallow. Continued home famotidine and PPI and 
___ resolved. 

# Nausea/Poor PO intake: Questionable h/o 14 lb weight loss in 
week prior to presentation. Pt reported inability to take PO for 
only 4 days, lacked significant systemic symptoms and was well 
appearing on exam. No recent diarrhea or emesis per patient 
report. Patient reported main barrier to PO intake to be 
constant nausea. He was treated symptomatically with ondansetron 
PO. Once he began tolerating PO, he had a very large meal which 
included ___ fries and chocolate cake and reported subsequent 
nausea. He was advised to follow a BRAT diet with small amounts 
of PO intake at a time to avoid exacerbating symptoms.

# Hypoglycemia: Pt reported that he was recently told he is 
diabetic but was not currently taking DM medications per his 
report and A1C this admission was normal. On admission to the 
surgical service, he had symptomatic hypoglycemia to ___ of 
unclear etiology. Fingerstick blood glucose recorded on ___ 
51->142->83. C-peptide and insulin levels were ordered given 
concern for factitious disorder vs malingering, but results were 
non-diagnostic because they were drawn after D50 was 
administered. A sulfonylurea level was added on to his admission 
labs and was negative. Hypoglycemia did not recur.

# H/o anaphylaxis: Pt reported recent episode of hives and 
""throat closing"" with amoxicillin. He plans to seek outpatient 
allergy f/u and was recently prescribed an epi pen. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

COMPARISON: None. 
  
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images through the brain were 
acquired without 
intravenous contrast. 
  
FINDINGS: The gray-white matter differentiation is preserved. 
There is no 
evidence of hemorrhage, mass, mass effect, shift of midline 
structures, or  
infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and 
configuration.  
Periventricular hypodensity adjacent to the frontal horn of the 
right lateral 
ventricle likely represents the sequelae of chronic ischemic 
microvascular 
disease. The calvarium is intact. The visualized paranasal 
sinuses are 
clear. Mild atherosclerotic calcification is noted within the 
cavernous 
carotid arteries bilaterally. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
No acute intracranial process. 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo F w/hx of CAD s/p MI, gout, hypothyroidism 
who presented to the ED with syncope and bradycardia in the 
___.
.  
#Syncope- The patient experienced some reflux of the food she 
had eaten and then felt lightheaded and passed out. She was 
found to have sinus bradycardia on presentation to the E.D. High 
on the differential is symptomatic bradycardia causing 
syncope.Per the patient she has a history of 1 episode of low HR 
causing her to past out a few years ago. The last EKG we have of 
her is in ___ when she was NSR in the ___. She denies having 
palpitations or experiencing lightheadedness on a regular basis, 
however she does say her atenolol makes her lightheaded. 
Vasovagal syncope given regurgitation of her food, and perhaps 
increased abdominal pressure, before passing out was also high 
on the differential. She also has a hx. of hypothyroidism which 
can cause bradycardia. Lower on the differential was seizure 
because of no typical clincial symptoms and PE because she 
denied any SOB and was never found to be tachycardic. Her heart 
rate was in the 40's and the tele showed sinus bradycardia. She 
was asymptomatic.However of note she does say she has been more 
fatigued than usual in the last week or two. We monitored on 
tele.-sinus bradycardia on ___-50.Held nodal blocking agents 
including atenolol and amlodipine during the admission and on 
discharge.She was hemodynamically stable.Checked TSH-2.6.Walked 
the patient and see if her heart rate increases above 60/minand 
####.Restarted HCTZ home dose on discharge, however will 
discontinue atenolol and amlodipine given baseline bradycardia 
and controlled hypertension with systolic blood pressures from 
100-110.Will need reassessment of blood pressure medications as 
outpatient.
.  
# Hypothyroidism- Continued home dose synthroid .Checked TSH-2.6 

.   
#Gout- Was not active, had no joint pains.Held colchicine  given 
no clinically active disease. Continued Allopurinol home dose   
.  
# HTN -Was not hypertensive during the admission, SBP's running 
in the 100- 120's 
Her atenolol was discontinued given her baseline bradycardia and 
her amlodipine was disconinued given her low blood pressures. 
She was discharged only on her home dose 25mg/day 
Hydrochlorthiazide. She will need outpatient follow up for 
titration of blood pressure medications.

Outpatient follow up 
-Patient's Blood pressure on admission was between 
105-130/60-80. Her atenolol was discontinued given her baseline 
bradycardia and her amlodipine was disconinued given her low 
blood pressures. She was discharged only on her home dose 
25mg/day Hydrochlorthiazide. She will need outpatient follow up 
for titration of blood pressure medications.
-Please consider outpatient cardiac stress test

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure to care for you as your doctor.
.
You were brought to the hospital because of losing consciousness 
and low heart rate. We carried out several exams and decided you 
needed no intervention at this time. You probably passed out 
because of low heart rate and a natural response to reflux of 
food called vagal response. 
.
We have discontinued some of your blood pressure medications on 
this admission because your blood pressures were well 
controlled. Please take your blood pressures at home and contact 
your primary care physician on future management of your blood 
pressure.
.
We made the following changes to your home medication list: 
STOP Atenolol due to low heart rate
STOP Amlodipine due to low blood pressure

Please talk to your primary doctor next week regarding your 
blood pressure and your medications. 

We continued the rest of your medications you were taking before 
being admitted to the hospital.

Please follow up with the outpatient appointments below:

hypothyroidism presents to the ___ ED with complaints of 
abdominal pain x 3 hours and syncope.  
.  
She reports she was in her USOH until she had acute onset of 
""achy"" gas like abdominal pain at 18:30 today, non-radiating, 
relieved by bowel movement. She had decreased liquid intake 
earlier in the day, and was out shopping with family and she 
passed out while exiting a car. She was eased to the ground, had 
cyanotic appeaing lips. She did not immediately regain 
consciousness, EMS was called who, according to the husband, 
performed 1 round of CPR, she regained consciousness and was 
brought to the ED. There as no documentation of the 
resuscitation event, no report of medications or cardioversion 
performed.

Of note she was admitted for a syncope work-up in ___. The ddx 
at that time included a vasovagal event versus symptomatic 
bradycardia. Her heart rate was in the ___ when EMS first 
evaluated her. Her amlodipine and atenolol were stopped and she 
was discharged with PCP ___ and suggestion for outpatient 
stress test. Her thyroid function tests during this admission 
were normal.  
.  
Speaking to the husband who was present during the event, he 
tells me that she was diaphoretic immediately following the 
event, and that her face was cold.  
.  
In the ED, initial VS: 97.6 57 146/75 16. On arrival to the ED, 
she had one large, soft brown, non bloody bowel movement with 
improvement in abdominal pain. She is conversant, neurologically 
intact and reports mild residual abdominal pain. Initial labs 
significant unremarkable liver function tests, chem7 and cbc. A 
troponin <0.01. A moderate demonstrated moderate leukocytes, 
small blood and few bacteria. Her stool was guaic negative. A 
bedside ultrasound was performed to rule out AAA. The aorta 
measured 1.3 x 1.6 in its maximal dimmension. Orthostatics were 
performed and were: 160/90 laying, 150/90 standing. She was

EKG: Sinus brady at 54bmp, 1st degree AV block. Q wave in III, 
aVF, unchanged from ___SSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is ___ year old lady with a history of 
CAD, gout, hypothyroidism presents to the ___ ED with 
complaints of abdominal pain x 3 hours and syncope.  
.  
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# SYNCOPE: On admission, pt had an unchanged EKG and normal 
troponins x 2, which effectively ruled out an ACS event. She 
denied any loss of bowel of bladder function, no tongue biting 
or post-ictal state to suggest a seizure. She did not experience 
any palpitations or heart racing prior the event, which made an 
arrythemia ___. There was high suspicion that this event 
was secondary to a vasovagal episode, most likely in setting of 
needing to have a bowel movement. Pt also has a history of 
bradycardia with 1st degree AV block which may have been 
contributing factor. The most recent TTE in our system was from 
___, however the patient states that she has had one more 
recently as an outpatient with Dr. ___. Unfortunately, we 
did not have access to this record. The patient has also worn a 
Holter monitor in the past, which she reports revealled no 
events. As part of her work up, TSH was order, which returned 
elevated. Her free T4 was pending at time of discharge. The 
patient was monitored on tele during her admission, which was 
remarkable only for sinus bradycardia. We attempted to get a 
Holter monitor for the patient prior to discharge, however given 
the holiday weekend, this was not possible. We have advised the 
patient to follow up with her PCP and outpatient cardiologist 
this week and recommend another heart monitor.
.  
# ABDOMINAL PAIN: This appears to have resolved with defacation. 
The emergency department considered possible AAA and a bedside 
ultrasound demonstrated 1.3 x 1.6 cm maximal dimmension. Her 
liver funtion tests and lipase were normal. Her stool guaiac was 
negative. Pt remained asymptomatic throughout her admission and 
tolerated PO well with no constipation or diarrhea.  
.  
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# HYPERTNESION: Pt was slightly hypertensive when she arrived on 
the floor with systolic BP 160s. With her medications, her blood 
pressure decreased to 140-150s. She was continued on her 
hydrochlorothiazide. 
.  
# HYPOTHRYOID:  Pt was continued on her home dose of 
levothyroxine 100mcg daily. Her TSH was slightly elevated, and 
her total T4 was pending at time of discharge.
.  
# GOUT:  Pt was continued on her home dose of allopurinol ___ mg 
daily.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# We have recommended that the patient be set up with a Holter 
monitor as an outpatient to monitor for any arrythmias that may 
have contributed to her syncopal episode. We also recommend a 
repeat TTE if she has not had one recently.
.
# Her TSH was slightly elevated, with a free T4 pending at time 
of discharge. This should be followed up as an outpatient, and 
adjusted as necessary.
.
# Pt had a urine culture pending at time of discharge.

diverticular abscess, presented originally to the ___ ED on 
___, found to have diverticulitis and constipation and 
discharged on cipro/clinda, now returns with another episode of 
lower abd pain, most likely consistent with known diagnoses.

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
# Acute, uncomplicated diverticulitis - The patient was recently 
found to have diverticulitis, diagnosed on CT abd/pelvis on 
___ and represented on ___ with similar abdominal pain. 
While patient does have a history of diverticulitis and 
diverticular abscess, this current episode can be considered 
uncomplicated. The patient was afebrile, with normal WBC at 7.3 
and normal lactate. On arrival to the floor, pain had diminished 
from ___ to ___ with no additional pain medication while 
in-house and the patient had a completely benign abdominal exam 
with no concerns for perforation. She was discharged on ___ 
from the ___ ED with a 10-day total course of 
ciprofloxacin/clindamycin (has Flagyl allergy), which she had 
been compliant with. She was continued on this regimen during 
her brief hospitalization and discharged to complete this 10-day 
course, with last dose ___. She tolerated a regular low 
residue diet in the hospital and did not require any additional 
pain medication, so she was discharged on ___. 

# Constipation - The patient presented to the ED on ___ with 
bowel pain and reports of not having had a bowel movement since 
her discharge from the ___ ED on ___. She had a large 
amount of stool seen in the sigmoid colon on CT abd/pelvis on 
___ but no stool in the vault on rectal exam on examination. 
Etiologies included medication-induced, as the patient had been 
taking Zofran at home for dizziness, which could have 
contributed to constipation. Furthermore, there could be an 
obstructive underlying mass (ddx colonic source vs. gyn source) 
given pelvic lymphadenopathy seen on CT abd/pelvis. Last 
colonoscopy was performed ___, which showed sessile polpys that 
were biopsied and revealed Langerhans cell histiocytoma 
(eosinophilic granuloma). The patient was given colace and 
Miralax for relief of constipation and she had two large bowel 
movements prior to discharge on ___ with relief of abdominal 
pain. To further investigate whether there is an underlying 
mass, the patient will need a repeat outpatient colonoscopy in 
___ weeks after her acute episode of diverticulitis has 
resolved. She was discharged on colace/Miralax.

emesis as well melena concerning for UGIB likely ___ alcoholic 
gastritis vs. esophagitis vs ___ tear.

# UGIB
Patient presented after having two episodes of 
hematemesis/coffee-ground emesis, and then proceeded to have 
large melena in ED. Hgb at presentation was 12.9 but 
subsequently dropped to 9.5 and then 8.9 in the setting of 
getting 2L IVF. Possible etiologies include ___ Tear, 
esophagitis, alcoholic gastritis, and NSAID use. Patient was 
planned to undergo EGD on ___ but unfortunately, given 
spinal fusion, anesthesia felt that it would be safest to 
perform procedure in the OR. Patient was hemodynamically stable 
for 48 hours since admission and had no major changes in his 
hemoglobin. Multiple conversations were had with the patient and 
the inpatient GI team about our preference of having him stay 
and undergo EGD in the OR given possible evidence of cirrhotic 
changes on liver US. Patient preferred to leave due to multiple 
life stressors outside of the hospital (including significant 
work issues with his boss) and the patient's presentation was 
thought to be less concerning for acute variceal bleed. This 
plan was discussed with GI consultants. Patient was educated 
about danger signs that should prompt an immediate return to the 
ED, and otherwise was encouraged to attend his scheduled follow 
up liver clinic where the EGD could be setup as an outpatient.

# ___
Cr was elevated to 1.2 at presentation from baseline 0.5. Likely 
pre-renal in setting of ongoing nausea limiting PO intake and 
vomiting. Patient received 2L IVF and Cr downtrended.

# Cirrhosis
# Transaminitis
Patient's liver enzymes were elevated on admission, AST/ALT 
100s-200s. Baseline abnormal likely due to ongoing alcohol use 
vs. fatty liver disease. He was also found to be leukopenic and 
thrombocytopenic. No stigmata of chronic liver disease on exam. 
RUQ U/S demonstrated stigmata of cirrhosis. Hepatitis serologies 
(HBV, HCV) were obtained and were all negative. Patient was 
started on hepatitis B vaccination series and received the first 
immunization on ___.

# Alcohol abuse
Patient formerly frank ten shots a night every night and drank 
continuously on weekends. He has since cut down and now drinks 
___ shots ___ nights a week. No history of withdrawal seizures 
though did require phenobarb during prior admission. At his 
reduced level of drinking, he did not have withdrawal on this 
admission. 
___ w/ EtOH abuse admitted w/ hematemesis and melena. Imaging 
and labs c/w a new diagnosis of cirrhosis. 
The patient was advised that even though he has cut down his 
drinking, his liver is now much more fragile than before and 
even small amounts of alcohol can cause further damage. He was 
educated on the life-threatening complications of cirrhosis and 
how he may not have any symptoms until it has become too late to 
undo the damage. He verbalized understanding of this, but does 
not feel quite ready to quit drinking. He was educated about 
naltrexone and other resources and agrees to readdress sobriety 
at his follow up visit. 

# H/o cervical fusion in ___
Pain was controlled with Tylenol, tizanadine, gabapentin, and 
oxycodone PRN.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[]EGD: Prompt outpatient EGD is recommended to clarify the cause 
of bleeding. Even if he has no further bleeding, the patient 
still needs to complete an EGD to screen for esophageal varices. 

[]Pending Labs: f/u h pylori stool antigen
[]Hepatology: Close followup in liver clinic given new diagnosis 
of cirrhosis
[]___ Screening: Patient will require q6 month ___ screening 
with abdominal ultrasound
[]Hepatitis B, non-immune: Patient was found to be hepatitis B 
non-immune, received first vaccine on ___, followup with 
course per recommended schedule
[]PPI: Discharged on PPI BID which should be continued until 
patient has GI follow up at ___
[] NO NSAIDS.
[] Continue discussion regarding alcohol cessation. He is 
potentially interested in naltrexone.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital. 

WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED:
- You were having bloody vomit and dark stools which concerned 
us that you were having a bleed from somewhere in your 
esophagus, stomach, or intestines. 

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL:
- We gave you fluids
- We took lab tests to see if you were bleeding quickly
- We had the GI doctors ___ by and ___ you, and they 
recommended that you get a procedure in which we look with a 
camera into your stomach. However, because of your neck 
surgeries, this would have to be done in the operating room. You 
decided that you did not want to wait and have this done so you 
were discharged with strict instructions to return if you start 
feeling ANY symptoms or experienced ANY bleeding
- You had imaging that suggested that you had cirrhosis in your 
liver. This needs follow up and further work up and it will be 
extremely important for you to follow up with a liver 
specialist.
- Importantly, you should NOT take any further ibuprofen, advil, 
naproxen, aleve. You should STOP drinking and consider a 
detoxification center.

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER LEAVING:
- Please take all of your medications as prescribed including a 
new medication:
  1.) Pantoprazole 40mg twice daily
- Please follow-up with your primary care doctor within the next 
___ weeks to have a repeat blood draw. 
- Please return to the hospital if you develop the following 
signs:

STUDIES 
EKG ___
Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. 
___ wave changes. Low voltage in the limb leads. 
No previous tracing available for comparison.
.
TTE ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= ___. 
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more 
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right 
ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall 
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened 
but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation 
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate 
to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting 
of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be 
underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] 
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is a small 
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most 
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Severely depressed LV systolic dysfunction with 
anterior/anteroseptal akinesis and hypokinesis of all segments 
bar basal inferior/inferolateral segments. Dilated and depressed 
right ventricle. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation likely 
due to leaflet tethering. Moderate to severe tricuspid 
regurgitation. At least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
Chest Xray ___
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions layer dependently. Cardiac 
silhouette
has a peculiar shape, and a larger than expected component to 
the right of
midline. Whether this is due to cardiomegaly or pericardial 
effusion is
indeterminate. There is no particular distention of either 
pulmonary or
mediastinal vasculature to suggest one or the other. Bibasilar 
atelectasis is relatively mild, and there is no pulmonary edema. 
Aortic contour is normal.
.
___
When compared to the study of ___, there is continued 
enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette with evidence of elevated pulmonary venous 
pressure. The
right heart border is now sharply seen, as is the hemidiaphragm, 
consistent
with substantial decrease in pleural effusion. However, this 
could represent a more erect position of the patient rather than 
significant fluid decrease.
 
There is opacification at the left base consistent with a small 
effusion on
this side.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y.o female with pmhx. of polycystic disease s/p bilateral 
native nephrectomies in ___ and then deceased donor renal 
transplant in ___ on Cellcept, Cyclosporine, and Prednisone, 
afib on ASA, type 2 DM, HTN had complicated recent hospital 
course (___) with recurrent pneumonia, exudative 
pleural effusion and infected hepatic cyst requiring ___ drainage 
c/b septic physiology requiring high volume resuscitation and 
vasopressors, complicated by hyperkalemia and worsening renal 
function, who presented to ___ clinic for second 
opinion regarding her increasing creatinine being admitted for 
volume overload and tachycardia. 
.
#Acute systolic heart failure- Patient was admitted with 
significant lower extremity edema, elevated JVD and pleural 
effusions. A TTE showed a EF of ___ anterior/anteroseptal 
akinesis and hypokinesis as well as moderate to severe mitral 
regurgitation.  She was diuresed with bolus doses of IV lasix 
(40 mg BID) approximately ___ L per day for 4 days.  Her weight 
on admission was 64.8 kg and 59 kg on discharge. She was 
transitioned to oral lasix 40 mg BID.  Cardiology was consulted 
a felt presentation was not complete consistent with ischemic 
cardiomyopathy and possibly reflective of a tachymyopathy.  She 
will however need further imaging with a MIBI or possible 
catheterization as an outpatient. She will also need a repeat 
TTE to evaluate valve and ventricular function now that she is 
no longer volume overloaded. She would likely also benefit from 
initiation as an ACEi as an outpatient when renal function 
improves. 
.
___ creatinine was 1.8 on admission from a baseline 
of 1.2. This was felt to likely reflect poor cardiac forward 
flow leading to hypoperfusion. Patient was diuresed as above 
with improvement in her creatinine to 1.6. Patient will 
___ with transplant nephrology. 
.
#Hepatic Cyst- Patient is status post drainage of cyst and drain 
removal ___. Per Infectious Disease at ___ patient was 
supposed to take 10 more days of Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl. 
However these antibiotics were discontinued at the time of 
admission as the patient had no signs of infection.  She 
remained afebrile with no signs of infection throughout the 
remainder of her hospital course.  
.
#Atrial Fibrilliation- Patient was noted to be in atrial 
fibrillation with rates as high as the 150s. Patient was 
asymptomatic without chest pain or palpitations. TSH was within 
normal limits.  In consultation with cardiology she was started 
on metoprolol tartrate which was titrated upward to 150 mg twice 
a day. This was converted to metoprolol succinate 150 mg BID. 
Rates remained elevated to the ___ and she was started on 
diltiazem with improved rate control.  The patient was only on 
aspirin on admission.  However she was initiated on warfarin at 
the time of discharge. The decision was made not to undertake 
bridging therapy. Patient will ___ in the ___ 
___ clinic for INR monitoring and warfarin dose 
adjustment.  
.  
#Kidney Transplant- Patient was continued on her home 
immunosuppresives, including Cyclosporine, Cell Cept and 
steroids. His BK virus PCR was negative.  Cyclosporine levels 
were appropriate.   
.  
#Thrombocytopenia- Patients platelets were noted to decrease 
from admission platelet count of 140's to the 80's with recovery 
to the 100s. In the differential is HIT and splenic 
sequestration. Heme onc consult has recommended HIT ab and 
various viral PCR's. The HIT antibody was negative. CMV viral 
load was negative. Parvovirus titers were negative and EBV 
titers were pending at the time of discharge.  Reticulocyte 
count was appropriate. Vitamin B12, folate and iron levels were 
within normal limits. Infectious ___ including blood and 
urine cultures were negative. There was no evidence of bleeding. 
The patient will need close monitoring of her platelet count as 
an outpatient. Patient will also need a US to rule out 
splenomegaly.  
.
#DM- Patient was maintained on an insulin sliding scale. Oral 
hypoglycemics were restarted on discharge.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- Patient will ___ with transplant nephrology, cardiology 
and with a new ___ PCP
- ___ INR monitoring and dose adjustment was transitioned 
to ___ clinic
- EBV titers were pending at the time of discharge
- Patient will need an US to evaluate for splenomegaly, repeat 
TTE and stress MIBI 
- Patient will need to have her creatinine and platelet count 
monitoring
- Patient was full code throughout this admission

Brief Hospital Course:
___ s/p renal transplant in ___ (unable to obtain IV dye), on 
immunosuppresion, s/p bilateral nephrectomies, afib on coumadin 
recently sub-therapeutic, who presents with ___ days of 
pleuritic chest pain under her left breast after 12 hours 
driving which resolved upon presentation. CP was of unclear 
cause. VQ scan was low probability. Patient notes some exercise 
recently and thinks this may have caused her pain. cardiac 
enzymes negative, EKG reassuring for ACS. patient was 
subtherapeutic on coumadin and has CHADS2 score of 3, and was 
treated with heparin gtt. Patient had fevers of unknown 
etiology, blood cultures were drawn which were pending at time 
of discharge.  The patient remained afebrile for 24 hours and 
was treated for presumed community acquired pneumonia given her 
subjective symptoms of pleuritic chest pain and pleural effusion 
on admission CXR.

# FEVERS -  Pt admitted for chest pain but spiked low grade 
fevers during admission. Initially placed on empiric vancomycin 
and zosyn, but continued spiking fevers without apparent source. 
 CXR showed minor pulmonary effusion on the R side. No 
localizing infectious symptoms, and fever resolved. Has 
reportedly had history of liver cyts which were again 
demonstrated on RUQ US without RUQ tenderness to palpation, thus 
not believed to be the source of intermittent fevers. The 
patient remained afebrile for 24 hours and was treated for 
presumed community acquired pneumonia given her subjective 
symptoms of pleuritic chest pain and pleural effusion on 
admission CXR without obvious localizing infectious signs, clear 
V/Q scan, and negative urine and blood cultures at the time of 
discharge.

# CP: The patient had an admission EKG and troponins reassuring 
for ACS, but reported pleuritic chest pain on admission.  Given 
a sub-therapeutic INR the patient was begun on a heparin drip, 
and with a recent history of travel and elevated d-dimer a V/Q 
scan was ordered which showed low probability of a pullmonary 
embolism. The patient's chest pain resolved completely by 
hospital day 2. Given that her only subjective complaint on 
admission was pleuritic chest pain, it was believed that her 
pain likely stemmed from a parapneumonic effusion and the 
patient was treated for community acquired pneumonia.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# AFIB - ensure patient taking coumadin 2 mg. Follow up INR on 
___
# Liver cysts and sacular intrahepatic bile duct dilation - 
Noted on RUQ US to assess for possible fever source. Radiology 
recommended MRCP for further evaluation. Pls consider GI 
referral if needed. (note: pt with transplanted kidney)
# Please monitor INR closely given concurrent levofloxacin 
administration
# Code Status: Full code 
# Emergency Contact/HCP: ___ (husband) ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It has been a pleasure taking part in your care during your 
hospitalization at ___. You 
were admitted for left sided chest pain, and there was concern 
for a possible blood clot in your lungs. A study was performed 
that showed that it is unlikely that there was a clot in your 
lung. However, you had high fevers, and there was concern for 
infection given that you take immune suppressive medications. An 
ultrasound showed cysts in your liver, and bile duct dilation, 
which will need to get followed up with an outpatient 
gastroenterologist. You were treated empirically with broad 
antibiotics and these were changed to levofloxacin to treat for 
community acquired pneumonia. Please monitor your INR very 
closely given that it may fluctuate with your antibiotics.

Please follow up with the appointments as scheduled below. 
Please continue to take your medications, and take your coumadin 
daily unless instructed otherwise by your doctor. Again, it has 
been a pleasure taking part in your care, and we wish you the 
best.

Sincerely,

- Your ___ care team

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with a history of renal transplant, CHF, AFib on Coumadin, 
DM who was admitted on ___ after she was found to have 
hyperglycemia (600s) and worsening renal function on routine lab 
tests at PCP (Cr 2.1 on ___, up from most recent 1.4 on 
___.

# Hyperglycemia / T2DM: 
Pt presented with significant hyperglycemia with ___ and 
elevated serum osms (but not meeting criteria for HHS). Treated 
with insulin in ED and developed low K. Given her significantly 
elevated glucose and HbA1c, the patient requires insulin therapy 
for glucose control. ___ was consulted and recommended the 
following regimen: NPH 10 Units fixed dose in the morning and 
Humalog sliding scale at meals (see discharge paperwork for 
scale). Her electrolyte abnormalities resolved with repletion 
and intravenous fluids. Her home glipizide was held. 

# Acute on chronic kidney disease s/p renal transplant: She 
presented with Cr 2.1, though her Cr has been baseline 1.2-1.3 
for many years. Her acute presentation is likely due to 
hypovolemia in setting of hyperglycemia and gradual decline in 
kidney function. She was given intravenous fluids, and her 
creatinine was followed closely. Her Lasix and Losartan were 
held during admission due to her dehydration and ___. Her home 
cyclosporine, prednisone, and MMF were continued. Cr was not 
back to baseline upon discharge. Losartan and Lasix held at 
discharge.

# UTI: She was also found to have a urinalysis suggestive of 
UTI, culture pending. This infection likely developed in setting 
of acute on chronic hyperglycemia. Endorsed urinary sx. She was 
treated with ceftriaxone 1g IV once daily and transitioned to 
cefpoxodime 500mg twice a day for a 7 day course (last dose 
___. Urine cultures were pending at the time of discharge.

#Extensive discussions were had with patient and husband 
regarding discharge plan. We requested that the patient stay 
overnight given the elevated Cr, pending urine cultures, 
electrolyte abnormalities, and need for additional fluid 
repletion and patient education. Patient insisted on discharge 
and agreed to help ensure very close follow-up.

CHRONIC:
# A-fib
Continued home warfarin at 0.5 and 1mg alternating (note was 
just changed on ___ per ___ clinic because INR was high. 
Continued diltiazem, metoprolol and digoxin.

# CHF

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You came to the hospital because you had very high blood sugar 
and bloodwork showing that your kidneys were not working as 
well.

While you were in the hospital, you were given insulin and 
intravenous fluids. Your Lasix and Losartan medications were 
held because you were very dehydrated. Your electrolyte levels 
were abnormal, which were repleted. You were also found to have 
a urinary tract infection, which was treated with antibiotics. 

Since your blood sugars were so high, it is very important that 
you take insulin every day, as prescribed. When you leave the 
hospital, you will also need to continue taking antibiotics 
(cefpodoxime 100 mg PO twice per day for 10 days) with last dose 
on ___.

PATHOLOGY: 
===============================
PLEURAL FLUID, LATERALITY NOT SPECIFIED:
POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Consistent with metastatic poorly-differentiated non-small cell 
neuroendocrine carcinoma.
A few small groups of and scattered single atypical epithelioid 
cells are seen on the cell block
preparation. Immunohistochemical stains show the atypical cells 
to be focally, weakly positive for
synaptophysin, and CK5/6. No immunoreactive cells for 
chromogranin are seen. The patient's prior
slides of lymph node biopsy (___) were not available for 
comparison. Drs. ___ and ___ were informed of the diagnosis via e-mail by Dr. ___ 
on ___

STUDIES: 
===============================
+ TTE ___: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is 
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical 
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully 
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF = 65%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve is not 
well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left 
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There 
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small 
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of 
tamponade.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old man with recently-diagnosed 
metastatic poorly-differentiated high-grade neuroendocrine 
carcinoma (likely of pulmonary origin), with bulky 
retroperitoneal/common iliac/mediastinal lymphadenopathy 
concerning for metastatic disease, who was admitted to ___ on 
___ with progressive dyspnea and hypoxemia thought to be at 
least partially related to ___ syndrome from an enlarging 
chest/neck mass, which was treated with external radiotherapy.  
Hospital course was been complicated by hypoxemic respiratory 
failure requiring prolonged mechanical intubation, sepsis ___ 
obstructive pneumonia, acute kidney injury ___ acute tubular 
necrosis, malignant pleural effusions requiring bilateral chest 
tube placement and hemodynamically unstable atrial fibrillation. 
Mr. ___ was followed closely by numerous consulting services 
(Heme-Onc, Pulmonary, Radiation Oncology, Nephrology, Infectious 
Disease). He developed progressive multi-system organ failure 
despite aggressive supportive care. Given his progressive 
decline and based on family wishes, his care was transitioned to 
a comfort focus and he was extubated with family at the bedside 
in accordance with his goals of care. He expired soon thereafter 
with official time of death being ___ @ 18:36. Autopsy was 
deferred.

Chief Complaint:
20 lb weight gain, DOE
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old F w/ history of hypertension,
obesity, osteoarthritis, hypothyroidism, and sarcoidosis
presenting for evaluation of a 20 lb weight gain in 1 week, DOE,
and lower extremity edema. She was seen by Cognitive Neurology
today who sent her in for evaluation. She reports that she woke
up approximately 3 days before admission with new lower 
extremity
swelling, DOE, bendopnea, and orthopnea. She also endorses chest
pain while walking that stops with slowing down. On ___, she 
was
265 pounds and today her weight is 293. She denies any chest
pain. She also has had three weeks of rhinorrhea, sore throat,
and a productive cough. 

In the ED, initial vital signs were T 99 HR 87 BP 135/106 RR 22
SPO2 96% RA. Her exam was notable for volume overload with
bilateral crackles and lower extremity edema. proBNP was only
221. TSH was normal. Hgb was newly decreased to 10.7. Urine
alb/Cr ratio was high at 109 and she had a low total protein of
5.8. ECG was unchanged from prior with sinus rhythm and
borderline LVH. Bedside cardiac ultrasound reportedly performed,
but not documented anywhere. CXR in the ED showed pulmonary
vascular congestion, so she was given 40 mg IV Lasix. 

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient reports the above story.
She is currently chest pain free, although notes dyspnea with
walking to the bathroom. Her legs feel lighter than before since
she received IV Lasix. This reminds her exactly of when she had
strep-induced nephritis at ___ years old. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
==================
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, syncope, or presyncope. On
further review of systems, denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. Denies exertional buttock or calf pain. Denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. All of the other review of systems 
were
negative.

History of Present Illness:
Mr ___ is a ___ year old man with cirrhosis (EtOH/HCV 
untreated, genotype 3)Child Class C, complicated by esophageal 
varices, ascites, and encephalopathy, chronic abdominal pain and 
multiple prior abdominal surgeries, presenting with 3 days of 
more severe RUQ pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.  

After a several month stay in rehab in ___ following his 
last ___ hospitalization in ___, the patient has been doing 
well at home. In his usual state of health, he has chronic RUQ 
abdominal pain, and is followed by his PCP and hepatologist; 
patient states that his pain has been attributed to possibly 
scar tissue from his several abdominal surgeries. He was 
previously on fentanyl patch for this but is now on oxycodone 
10mg QID. ___ checked ___. Last filled oxycodone 10mg 30 
day supply (120 pills) ___.  

He has Child's class C cirrhosis but overall his ascites and 
hepatic encephalopathy are well controlled with 
Lasix/spironolactone and lactulose. Prior paracentesis was 
""Several years ago.""  

He developed his present symptoms 3 days ago, with the subacute 
onset of worsening RUQ pain (stabbing, constant with waves of 
more severe pain, worse with vomiting, no change with 
eating/position/movement). For the past 3 days he has also had 
___ episodes per day of vomiting (clear/yellow fluid, no blood 
or coffee-ground emesis), and has been unable to tolerate food, 
or fluids, and thinks he has also vomited pills (although has 
been trying to stay compliant with his regimen). He has also 
been having multiple episodes per day of watery/yellow fluid 
diarrhea (no blood or melena).  

His ROS is positive for chills/sweats, and fatigue. His 
abdominal distention is moderate but stable. But he denies 
fevers, myalgia/arthralgias, HA, URI symptoms, visual complaint, 
chest pain/pressure, dyspnea, cough, rash, bruising, lower 
extremity edema. No recent travel, sick contacts, or recent 
raw/uncooked/spoiled food.

He presented to the ED for further evaluation.

pain that he describes as sharp and in his upper abdomen.  He
also had several episodes of emesis, reporting his vomit as 
being
dark brown in character.  Decided to re-present to ED for
reevaluation of abdominal pain given acute worsening status. 
Most recently presented to the ED over the weekend where he got 
a
CT abdomen pelvis that did not show any acute interval changes
compared to prior scans.  Was discharged home with expectant
management, transplant surgery was not consulted at that time. 
Now, underwent repeat CT scan showing free air and fluid in the
lesser sac concerning for gastric perforation.  Transplant
surgery is consulted for surgical management of this disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
Summary: 
---------
Mr ___ is a ___ man with alcoholic and hepatitis C 
cirrhosis who presented with abdominal pain, and was found to 
have a perforated inoperable duodenal and stomach ulcer.  

Active Issues:
--------------
# DUODENAL AND GASTRIC ULCERS with
# ___ GUIDED DRAINAGE OF LESSER SAC COLLECTION:
The patient presented to the ___ Emergency Department with 
abdominal pain. There was evidence of perforated ulcer on both 
CT abdomen and upper GI series (posterior antral leak to lesser 
sac). Initially he was kept NPO with IV hydration and placed on 
broad-spectrum antibiotics with pip-tazo and fluconazole from 
___. 
He underwent EGD on ___ with the following finding: large 
ulcer measuring approximately 5-6cm was seen in the first part 
of the duodenum.  There was likely perforation around the edge 
of the ulcer measuring 2-3cm -This appeared contained. The 
perforation was too large for endoscopic intervention. There was 
also moderate to severe esophagitis in the distal esophagus with 
portal hypertensive gastropathy seen. H. pylori was negative. He 
was put on the maximum dose of PPI.  A NG was in place. 
He underwent exploratory laparotomy by Dr. ___, but 
was found to have a frozen abdomen thus unable to see perforated 
stomach. Postop, he was transferred to the SICU for management 
as he was hypotensive and hematocrit had decreased. He was given 
albumin and 4 units of PRBC. Hct stabilized, but on ___, he 
had brief episode of SVT with rate of 160 without blood pressure 
drop; afib with intermittent RVR that was treated with 
metoprolol IV x 2 with decrease in BP. The patient required 
pressors and amiodarone was started (please see #Afib below). 

He transferred out of the SICU and was started on TPN. Afib was 
managed with metoprolol. Metoprolol dose was increased and he 
was given intermittent doses of Lasix for volume control and 
pulmonary edema seen on CXR. 

His diet was initially advanced to clears then full liquids. 
However, he did not tolerate advancement to a regular diet. He 
experienced a lot of abdominal pain. Diet was changed to just 
sips of clears and pain was managed with a Dilaudid PCA.  His 
diet was eventually changed to tube feeds and then regular diet 
as per an initial goals of care discussion. An abdominal CT 
___ an 8cm loculated fluid collection in lesser 
sac. He then underwent ___ placement of a drain in the 
fluid collection. Microbiology evaluation of the fluid 
collection did not grow any organisms, so antibiotics were 
discontinued on ___.  ___ continued to follow the drain until 
output was < 5cc for 2 consecutive days, at which point the 
drain was pulled.  Diet was advanced slowly for comfort, with 
supplemental nutrition from nasogastric tube feeds.  After a 
goals of care meeting on ___, Pt endorsed a desire to 
transition towards measures that would improve his comfort.  In 
light of this, his NGT was pulled ___ and he was permitted a 
regular PO diet, which he tolerated well. Patient was continued 
on sucralfate for continued gastric coating and comfort.  PPI 
and other unnecessary medicines were held.

# GOALS OF CARE DISCUSSION:
Pt with poor prognosis due to his perforated viscus, surgically 
frozen abdomen, and non-transplant candidacy.  A goals of care 
meeting was held on ___ with the patient and his friend, as 
well as newly-chosen HCP, ___.  At this meeting, Pt 
acknowledged the severity of his illness and endorsed a 
willingness to transition his course more towards 
comfort-focused care.  Medicines that would not contribute to 
his comfort were discontinued.  Unnecessary tubes and lines, 
including his NGT and PICC line, were removed prior to 
discharge.  Patient was discharged to a ___ facility for 
housing and further titration of his care.

# ETOH/HCV CIRRHOSIS with
# ASCITES and
# NEED FOR SBP PPX:
Previously complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, grade 
I esophageal varices.  Pt without significant hepatic 
encephalopathy or large ascites during his hospital stay; he was 
initially put on oral diuretics to minimize the ascites and risk 
of wound dehiscence, but these were held in the setting of 
significant weight loss while on tube feeds and overall hypo- to 
euvolemic appearance on exam.  Patient was continued on Bactrim 
for SBP prophylaxis.  He was continued on lactulose to keep his 
mental status clear.  Given goals of care discussion as above, 
vitamins such as thiamine and multivitamin were discontinued.

# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:
Had one episode of Afib on ___, for which he was amiodarone 
loaded and started on amio gtt.  He was stable on PO metoprolol 
in-house, though sometimes limited due to soft blood pressures.  
He had a CHADS-VASC of 0.  Given his goals of care discussion at 
discharge, PO metoprolol was discontinued.  Anticoagulation was 
deferred given recent surgery as well as goals of care 
discussion as above.

# NUTRITION:
Initially requiring TPN, then tube feeds by ___.  He 
continued to lose muscle mass despite optimal nutrition on TF's. 
 After goals of care discussion ___, patient was provided with 
a regular diet - which he tolerated well.

ulcer), that could not be repaired due to scarred down tissue in 
your abdomen (frozen abdomen)
- You were given antibiotics to prevent infection
- You had a temporary drain placed in your abdomen to drain an 
infection, and this was removed. 
- You initially were given a feeding tube to bypass the hole, 
but as it healed from the inside, you were able to eat regular

Brief Hospital Course:
IMAGING: 

RUQ US ___: 
1. Biliary sludge without evidence of gallbladder-wall 
thickening
or intrahepatic biliary dilatation. 
2. No evidence of focal liver lesions

MRCP ___:
1. Moderate intra and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation 
with
duct penetrating sign suggestive of inflammatory rather than
neoplastic stricture. Correlation with ERCP may be considered. 
No
evidence of choledocholithiasis or definite obstructing mass. 2.
Short-segment (11 mm) eccentric filling defect within the main
portal vein, suspicious for nonocclusive thrombus. 3. Sludge
within the gallbladder lumen. 4. Status post left nephrectomy
with stable soft tissue within the left nephrectomy bed. 5.
Multiple pancreatic cystic lesions, likely small side branch
IPMNs, measuring up to 10 mm.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
___ w/ ID-T2DM, HTN, DL, BPH, and metastatic clear cell RCC, s/p
radical L nephrectomy in ___, found to have pulmonary,
mediastinal, and hilar mets ___, now on ___, randomized 
to
sunitinib, dose-reduced, currently 2 weeks off sunitinib per
protocol, who is directly admitted from clinic for abnormal LFTs
found on routine lab screening. 

# Elevated LFTs
Non-specific elevations. US did not reveal any focal lesions nor
any biliary dilatation nor stones. Lipase elevated at 252 but in
absence of any abd pain, unlikely pancreatitis. Unlikely
sunitinib effect per oncology. Pt did appear to be lethargic per
oncologist but is AOx3 and no asterixis, but cannot rule out 
some
element of encephalopathy. Found on MRCP to have moderate
intra/extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation suggestive of
stricture. Hepto wnl and anemia stable, so unlikely hemolysis.
SPEP largely wnl.  

ERCP on ___ revealed stricture in bile duct and had plastic 
biliary
stent placed. He tolerated procedure well. Had no infectious 
symptoms
nor any signs of post-ercp pancreatitis. He was advanced to full 
diet 
and instructed to f/u with oncology for the results of the 
brushings 
done during ERCP. Their team will coordinate a repeat ERCP in 4 
wks. 

# Portal Vein THrombus
MRCP revealed a small non-occlusive filling defect within the
main portal vein suspicious for thrombus. Due to risk of 
progression,
patient was started on once daily dosing lovenox at 1.5 mg/kg.
Due to sphincterotomy during the ERCP, patient was instructed to 

wait 5 days after ercp to start the lovenox. He was provided 
teaching
on how to inject and warning signs while he was here.

# Pancreatic cysts 
Found on MRCP, per radiology, felt to be to be small side branch
Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.

to
the lungs, mediastinum, and hilum currently on chemotherapy
(experimental trial; on sunitinib), with recent admission
(___) for biliary stricture s/p ERCP with plastic stent
placement (CBD brushing cytology non-diagnostic) and
non-occlusive portal vein thrombus started on enoxaparin who
presented to the ED with fever, jaundice, and confusion.

The CBD brushing cytology from his prior admission was
non-diagnostic. His imaging was reviewed at multidisciplinary
pancreas conference and no mass lesion was visualized in the 
head
of the pancreas but there was some peripancreatic stranding
around the head of the pancreas noted. There was some concern 
for
a potential primary pancreatobiliary tumor (rather than rare RCC
metastasis to pancreas), so he was planned for a repeat ERCP and
EUS in ___ weeks (planned for the week of ___ off sunatinib).

He last followed up in ___ clinic with Dr. ___ on 
___.
He was complaining of a week of increased fatigue, nausea, and
poor PO intake. His sunatinib was held due to concern for side
effects. Over the past week since then, he has had worsening
jaundice and fatigue. Last night, he developed chills,
restlessness, mild confusion, and fevers to 101, which prompted
his wife to bring him to ___. He was
transferred from there to the ___ ED.

Right now, he feels ok, just a little tired. He feels like his
thinking is foggy. No fevers/chills since he presented to the
hospital. No nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. He has had loose
stools, which he associates with the sunatinib. No bloody,

PATHOLOGY/CYTOLOGY:
Biliary mass biopsy (___): Minute fragment of highly 
atypical cells with sclerotic stroma consistent with 
adenocarcinoma
Common bile duct stricture brushings (___):
POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. - Adenocarcinoma.

IMAGING:
RUQ US (___):
IMPRESSION: 
1. Persistent mild left intrahepatic biliary dilation in 
presence
of a partially visualized CBD stent raises concern for stent
malfunction.  Compared to the prior ultrasound, the degree of
intrahepatic biliary dilation has not changed significantly. 
2. Persistent gallbladder sludge. 

ERCP ___:
removal of the old stent and placement of a new stent over a 2cm 
malignant-appearing stricture
of the distal CBD. Cytology brushings were sampled.

EUS ___:
1.8 x 1.1 cm ill-defined hypoechoic area around the distal CBD. 
FNB was performed x3

CT torso ___:
IMPRESSION: 
Non obstructive pneumonia, left upper lobe.
Minimal residual pulmonary edema and pleural effusions 
attributable to heart failure.
Atherosclerotic coronary calcification.
Left PICC line ends just above the superior cavoatrial junction.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of local recurrence or metastatic disease in the 
abdomen and
pelvis.
2. Mild intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, 
with CBD
stent in place.
3. Known nonocclusive main portal vein thrombus appears 
increased in size,
though difficult to directly compare to MR due to differences in 
imaging
technique.

ERCP ___: Biliary plastic stent removed with a snare. A 
metal stent was placed over 2cm long malignant appearing 
stricture in the distal CBD. 

TTE ___:
IMPRESSION: Adequate image quality. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global left ventricular systolic function. No 2D 
echocardiographic evidence for endocarditis. If clinically 
suggested, the absence of a discrete vegetation on 
echocardiography does not exclude the diagnosis of endocarditis.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY/ASSESSMENT:   
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with IDDM, HTN, BPH, and 
metastatic clear cell RCC s/p radical L nephrectomy (___) on 
chemotherapy (sunitinib), with recent admission (___) for 
biliary stricture s/p ERCP with plastic stent placement (CBD 
brushing cytology non-diagnostic) and non-occlusive portal vein 
thrombus started on enoxaparin who presented to the ED with 
fever, jaundice, and confusion, found to have persistent 
intrahepatic biliary dilation and gallbladder sludge on ___ US 
s/p ERCP x2 with placement of plastic, then metal biliary stent 
and EUS with pathology from FNB of CBD mass consistent with new 
pancreatobiliary adenocardinoma. 

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Cholangitis
# Strep spp. (likely Enterococcus) bacteremia
# Adenocarcinoma pancreaticobiliary origin
He presented with fever, jaundice, and mental status changes. 
RUQ US also showed persistent left intrahepatic biliary dilation 
and gallbladder sludge despite the presence of CBD stent, 
suggesting that the stent was non-functioning/occluded or there 
was some other source of obstruction. The CBD brushing cytology 
from his prior ERCP was non-diagnostic. He had no apparent mass 
in the head of the pancreas on imaging but there remained some 
concern for a primary pancreatobiliary tumor so he was planned 
to have a repeat ERCP and EUS the week he was admitted.
Blood culture at ___ is growing Strep spp. He was treated with 
Unasyn for cholangitis as well as Strep bacteremia. BCx here 
grew Strep anginosus. He had an ERCP on ___ with removal of the 
old stent and placement of a new stent over a 2cm 
malignant-appearing stricture of the distal CBD. Cytology 
brushings were sampled. EUS was completed on which they 
visualized a 1.8 x 1.1 cm ill-defined hypoechoic area around the 
distal CBD. FNB was performed x3. Pathology was consistent with 
adenocarcinoma.  
After the plastic stent placement, his LFTs did not improve and 
bilirubin continued to rise. A repeat ERCP was done on ___ with 
removal of the plastic stent and placement of a metal stent. 
After this, his LFTs started to improve. His Unasyn was changed 
to ceftriaxone and metronidazole for ease of dosing to complete 
a 2 week course ___ - ___. A PICC was placed prior to 
discharge. TTE did not show evidence of endocarditis.

# ___ on CKD
Cr peaked at 1.8 from baseline 1.2. Most likely this was 
prerenal in the setting of cholangitis. It improved after ERCP, 
antibiotics, and fluid resuscitation. 

# PVT
He was found to have a non-occlusive portal vein thrombus on 
MRCP during his recent hospital admission and was started on 
enoxaparin. HIs home enoxaparin was initially held for ERCP, 
then resumed. 

# Macrocytic anemia
Macrocytic anemia is chronic. Baseline H/H appears to be ___, 
so he is lower than baseline. He had no signs of bleeding.  
Recent TSH, folate, B12, ferritin, and TIBC were wnl. Bilirubin 
is predominantly direct, so less likely hemolysis. Other 
hemolysis labs were not consistent with hemolysis. Acute on 
chronic anemia is perhaps ___ bone marrow suppression from 
sepsis. He was given 1 unit pRBCs for Hgb 7.6. 

# Metastatic clear cell RCC on chemotherapy
He is followed at ___ by Dr. ___. He was diagnosed in 
___ in workup of gross hematuria and flank pain. He underwent a 
laparoscopic radical right nephrectomy in ___. He was found 
to have metastases to the lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes, and 
hilar lymph nodes in ___. In ___ he was enrolled in an 
experimental trial and started on sunatinib. His most recent CT 
showed clinical response. He is currently in his regularly
scheduled two weeks off on sunatinib. He had a surveillance CT 
on ___ which showed  no evidence of local recurrence of 
metastatic disease in the abdomen/pelvis. 

# LUL pneumonia
He was found to have LUL opacity on CT chest ordered for 
surveillance. He was also complaining of cough. He was on Unasyn 
while inpatient, then transitioned to ceftriaxone and 
metronidazole for 2 weeks total, which should cover him for 
pneumonia.

# HTN
Initially his home atenolol dose was halved due to concern for 
cholangitis/impending sepsis. His home amlodipine 10 mg and 
lisinopril 40 mg daily were also initially held. These were 
resumed prior to or at discharge. 

# Insulin-dependent DM type II
At home he takes glargine 16 units qhs if his FSBG is <170 and 
he takes 18 units qhs if his FBSG is >170. While inpatient, he 
was given glaring 8 units qhs as he was not taking much PO as 
well as lispro SSI. 

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
# Hypothyroidism - continued home levothyroxine

# Depression and anxiety - continued home fluoxetine; held home
cariprazine as it is non-formulary

Mr. ___ is clinically stable for discharge. The total time 
spent today on discharge planning, counseling and coordination 
of care was greater than 30 minutes.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital after you were found to have a 
blockage of your bile ducts causing a serious infection called 
cholangitis. You were also found to have bacteria in your blood 
stream.  You underwent an ERCP with a plastic stent placed. 
After the procedure your bilirubin continued to rise and you 
underwent a second ERCP to place a metal stent. 

For your serious infection you were started on IV antibiotics 
and will need to continue this for two weeks. 

This blockage in the bile duct was caused by a stricture. 
Samples of the stricture were taken and found to be cancer 
(adenocarcinoma). You were seen by the oncology team and have 
follow up with them in a few days to talk about treatment 
options. 

It was a pleasure caring for you,
Your ___ Team

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief hospital summary:
=======================
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with history metastatic 
RCC, locally advanced cholangiocarcinoma s/p six months of 
gemcitabine and cisplatin, and recent diagnosis of pancreatic 
acinar cell carcinoma receiving liposomal irinotecan and 
___ who presents with hypotension and acute on 
chronic renal failure. Hypotension and ___ resolved with IVFs 
and holding BP medications. He was discharged in stable 
condition. 

Transitional issues:
==============
[] Hgb on discharge 8.3.
[] Held home lisinopril, atenolol, and amlodipine given concern 
for dehydration and hypotension. BPs improved during course of 
hospital stay.
[] Please titrate BP medications on outpatient basis as 
clinically indicated 
[] Cr on discharge 1.7 (baseline appears to be 1.4-1.7). Please 
recheck BMP within one week of discharge to trend Cr.
[] Glipizide held on discharge due to increase risk of 
hypoglycemia. Would consider d/c vs restart based on renal 
function

Acute issues:
==========
# Hypotension: Likely combination of poor PO intake and 
dehydration in setting of poor appetite and nausea from new 
chemotherapy regimen while continuing multiple home BP 
medications. Given IVF and held BP medications with resolution 
of hypotension. Orthostatics prior to discharge unremarkable. 

# ___ on CKD: Likely prerenal in setting of poor PO intake. FeNa 
<1% consistent with diagnosis. Held lisinopril which we will 
continue to hold upon discharge. Renal ultrasound without 
evidence of hydronephrosis. 

# Anemia: Likely secondary to chemotherapy and malignancy. 
Hemolysis labs reassuring. No clinical evidence of bleeding. Hgb 
on discharge 8.3.

Chronic issues:
===============
# Fatigue: Likely from anemia and chemotherapy side effect. 
Stable during course of hospitalization

# Pancreatic Acinar Cell Carcinoma:
# Cholangiocarcinoma:
# Secondary Neoplasm of Liver: Currently on palliative liposomal 
___. Follow-up with Dr. ___

# Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma:
# Secondary Neoplasm of Lung: He is on a treatment hold due to 
the management of his cholangiocarcinoma and now pancreatic 
cancer.

# Portal Vein Thrombus: continued home rivaroxaban

intraperitoneal air. Osseous structures are unremarkable. 
Re-demonstrated is a common bile duct extent in grossly 
unchanged position compared to the prior study given differences 
in techniques. Two small linear
hyperdensities noted over the midline adjacent to the biliary 
stent, likely surgical clips.
IMPRESSION: Imaging findings concerning for small-bowel 
obstruction.  Further evaluation with CT abdomen and pelvis, 
with iv contrast, is recommended.

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITH ORAL CONTRAST ___:
1. Interval increase in size of pancreatic head mass, now 
measuring up to 8.0 cm, previously 6.0 cm.
2. Numerous metastatic lesions throughout the liver, increased 
in size and number.
3. Interval worsening of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
4. Wall thickening of an approximately 20 cm segment of distal 
and terminal ileum with adjacent fat stranding, compatible with 
infectious or inflammatory ileitis.  No small bowel obstruction. 
 Oral contrast is seen to the rectum.
5. New 3 mm pulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with type 2 diabetes, 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, BPH, and three concurrent cancers: 
(1) metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma, s/p radical L 
nephrectomy in ___, found to have pulmonary,
mediastinal, and hilar metastases ___ (now off sunitinib 
without disease progression), (2) metastatic cholangiocarcinoma 
s/p 6 months gem/cisplatin, who subsequently had new (3) acinar 
cell carcinoma of the pancreas, now on ___ I regimen of 
liposomal irinotecan and ___, last dose ___, who went to 
___ clinic with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and was 
found to have possible SBO on KUB.  This led to direct admission 
for workup.  CT abdomen/pelvis with oral contrast showed no 
evidence of bowel obstruction, but showed findings of ileitis, 
as well as increasing pancreatic mass size and new hepatic 
lesions all concerning for progression of his cancer.  While 
hospitalized, he developed recurrent symptoms of nausea, 
vomiting after an initial improvement, and then developed signs 
and symptoms of frank obstruction likely related to his 
pancreatic mass or peritoneal carcinomatosis.  No further 
imaging was pursued.  An NG tube was placed for decompression 
and he had significant improved symptoms.  He subsequently 
underwent palliative venting G-tube is a transition to hospice.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Abdominal pain
# Nausea and vomiting, with malignant obstruction, in setting of 
progressive acinar cell cancer, and large pancreatic mass
# Acinar cell pancreatic cancer
He has been off sutinib as his other cancers are being managed 
and his pulm/hepatic mets have been stable. He is not yet due 
for restaging imaging. He is due for
___, LV, liposomal irinotecan. His oncologists are Dr ___ 
___ Dr ___ seen on ___.  CT abdomen/pelvis showed 
increased size of pancreatic head mass (from 6.0 to 8.0 cm), 
numerous metastatic liver lesions (increased in size and 
number), interval worsening of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, 
and new 3 mm pulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe.  He had 
been having nausea and vomiting likely related to chemo for 
several weeks, but then developed diarrhea, vomiting, and 
abdominal pain the night prior to presentation. His symptoms 
have resolved.  He had 2 watery bowel movements after admission. 
 KUB had showed multiple centrally located distended loops of 
small bowel, concerning for small bowel obstruction.  He has not 
had prior bowel obstruction.  Since he has only 1 kidney with a 
Cr of 1.6, initial CT was done without IV contrast.  CT 
abdomen/pelvis with oral contrast showed no evidence of bowel 
obstruction, but showed wall thickening of distal and terminal 
ileum with adjacent fat stranding, compatible with infectious or 
inflammatory ileitis.  Since he was afebrile with improved 
symptoms, empiric antibiotics were not started.  C. difficile 
was negative as was ecoli.   He was initially treated with bowel 
rest and IV fluids, then diet was advanced.  The CT scan also 
showed increasing size of pancreatic mass, enlarging and new 
hepatic lesions, new left lung nodule, worsening retroperitoneal 
lymphadenopathy, all concerning for progression of disease.   
Given this new complication of his pancreatic cancer, family 
meeting was held on ___, with a decision to pursue hospice 
care at home given no other therapeutic options.  His prognosis 
was given as weeks.  He was transitioned to liquid concentrated 
morphine for pain, as well as lorazepam for anxiety, and 
dexamethasone for nausea.  Oral medications were given after his 
PEG was placed, with clear instructions on how to take them.  
This included dexamethasone, concentrated morphine, and 
olanzapine.  Other home medications were continued at this time, 
with decisions to stop these medications going forward to occur 
with hospice services and Dr. ___, patient's 
oncologist.  MOLST form was completed.

# Acute on chronic anemia: Baseline hemoglobin is ___.  
Hemoglobin was low at 6.7 on ___, so he was transfused 1 unit 
PRBCs with improvement to 8.3.  He had no obvious signs of acute 
blood loss anemia and stool has not appeared grossly bloody or 
signs of melena evident.  His blood count remained stable.  Labs 
were not checked after goals of care were changed.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
# Chronic kidney disease: Creatinine is 1.4-1.6 at baseline.  He 
had recent ___ with Cr of 2.2 on ___ and 1.8 on admission, 
likely due to dehydration. Renal function returned to baseline 
after getting IV fluids then rose after he likely developed 
recurrent dehydration.  As stated above labs were not rechecked 
after goals of care change.

# History of Portal Vein Thrombus: He was continued on home 
Rivaroxaban 10mg daily, except for initially being held while 
NPO.  This was continued for now, but should be stopped if 
decided not consistent with comfort going forward.

# Severe protein-calorie malnutrition: He has low albumin and 
reported low oral intake due to nausea, vomiting, and abdominal 
pain, which has been ongoing off/on for weeks, likely due to 
chemo and his known cancers.  Consulted nutrition who 
recommended low fiber diet with Ensure Clear early in 
hospitalization, but given transition to hospice, he was 
recommended to have diet as tolerated.

# Type 2 diabetes: His glargine was initially decreased while 
NPO on IV D5LR, then stopped and treated with sliding scale 
insulin only and Glipizide was held.  On discharge, glipizide 
was continued.

TRANSITIONS OF CARE

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were hospitalized with abdominal pain.  Despite the fact 
that you initially improved, you subsequently worsened and the 
symptoms were all related to progressive cancer.  We talked 
about the meaning of this with you and your family and you are 
opting to go home with hospice care.  We put a gastric tube in 
to help alleviate any symptoms of obstruction.  You should keep 
the gastric tube hooked up to low suction overnight and when you 
are not doing anything during the day.  When you are active, and 
for ___ minutes after taking oral medications, you should 
clamp the tube.

You were continued on most of your oral medications that you 
take at home.  Over time, you may decide to discontinue these 
medications if they are not necessary for your comfort (for 
instance, your vitamin supplements), and can discuss this with 
your hospice team.

The hospice team will help you manage your symptoms at home.

We wish you the best of luck going forward. 

Thanks,

Your ___ Team

Hospital Medicine Attending Progress Note

Time patient seen and examined today

HPI on Admission:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with a PMHX of partial aortic 
dissection, HTN, who presents w/ HA & fever x2d concerning for 
meningitis.

Patient reports that 3 days ago, he developed malaise and 
terrible headache: constant, dull, diffuse. The following day, 
headache was relenting ___ pain. Also had fever of 102 and 
took tylenol/ibuprofen without relief of symptoms. He reports 
nausea and decreased PO intake. Denies vision changes, 
sensitivity to light, syncope, URI sx, chest pain, shortness of 
breath, abd pain, diarrhea/constipation, sick contacts. Has mild 
neck stiffness as well. He lives in ___, does a lot of
yardwork. Has had exposure to ticks, mosquitoes, but none he 
memorably recalls recently. No recent travel hx. No rash. He was 
feeling entirely well prior to onset of these symptoms. Given 
terrible headache and fever, he presented to the ED. 

Hospital Course to Date:

The pt was admitted for acute onset headache and fever. LP 
showed a cell count of 141 with lymphocytic predominance and 
elevated protein to 100. He was initially started on bacterial 
meningitis coverage, then narrowed to acyclovir based on 
negative CSF stain and cultures. Doxycycline was added to cover 
potential lyme
meningitis. The pt's CSF came back positive for HSV PCR. Per ID 
recommendations from ___: ""Would recommend continuing on 
Acyclovir for now but when safe for discharge can change to 
Valtrex 1 gram po three times per day to complete 14 day course.
In setting of only low positive HSV 2 PCR and extensive outdoor 
activity would also complete 14 day course of doxycycline even 
though lyme is less likely."" The pt improved dramatically. His 
headache resolved. Throughout his hospitalization, he had no 
confusion or neurologic deficits. He was transitioned to oral 
acyclovir the day before discharge and discharged on PO 
acyclovir + PO doxycycline for a total 14 day course.

Of note, the pt was incidentally found to have an abnormally low 
Hb on admission. He required 1u PRBC transfusion ___. He denies 
any known bleeding. GI was consulted and recommended EGD + 
colonoscopy, performed ___. EGD showed diffuse erythema of 
the mucosa with no bleeding noted in the antrum, consistent with 
gastritis. Colonoscopy showed a circumferential mass of 
malignant appearance in the distal rectum completely encircling 
the rectal verge. There were local ulcerations in the 12:00 
position. Colorectal surgery was consulted. They recommended 
follow up at the colorectal cancer clinic. Follow up was 
arranged prior to discharge and the pt was aware of the 
diagnosis and need for follow up. The clinic and colorectal 
surgery asked for a baseline CEA which was normal. They asked 
for a staging MRI pelvis which did not show any spread of the 
presumed cancer. Pathology was sent by GI. Initial pathology 
showed superficial fragments of tubulovillous adenoma. This was 
pending at the time of discharge, though initial reports had 
shown the same diagnosis, so the pt was instructed to follow up 
with GI. The GI phone number was shared with the patient and he 
was instructed to call them directly if he did not hear from the 
clinic within 24 hours. The pt received a total of 2u PRBCs this 
hospitalization. Hb was 7.2 on the morning of discharge and the 
pt received 1u PRBCs (the second unit this stay) on the day of 
discharge after the Hb of 7.2 in order to ensure that his Hb did 
not drop below 7.0 at home. Close follow up was arranged prior 
to discharge. The pt had no active bleeding at the time of 
discharge. Return to ER precautions such as dizziness and 
increased bleeding were reviewed with the patient.

The pt's BP meds were held on admission but restarted prior to 
discharge.

IMAGING:
CXR ___: 
Stable cardiomegaly and moderate pulmonary edema with a small 
right pleural 
effusion. A chest x-ray following diuresis is recommended 
  
CT head ___:
1. No significant interval change in bilateral subdural 
hematomas, as well as a rounded hemorrhagic focus within the 
right occipital lobe, which may also be extraaxial. 
2. Punctate foci of layering hemorrhage within the occipital 
horns of lateral ventricles, unchanged. 
3. No new hemorrhage identified 
  
CT C-spine ___: 
1. No fracture identified. 
2. Severe multilevel degenerative changes, with a grade 1 
anterolisthesis of C5 on 6, of indeterminate chronicity. 
However, clinical correlation is 
suggested. If there is a high clinical concern for ligamentous 
or cord 
injury, an MRI is suggested 
   
ECHO ___:
Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with mildly depressed global 
systolic function. Severe diastolic dysfunction. Severe aortic 
stenosis. Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
   
CT head ___:
1. No significant change in the subdural hemorrhages, noted, in 
the right 
frontal, right parietal and the left tentorial as well as along 
the 
cerebral convexity based on both sides compared to the most 
recent study. 
Follow up as clinically indicated. 
  
CT Spine ___:
1. No acute fracture within the limitation of severe osteopenia. 

2. Large lesion at S2 level, expanding and indenting S2, likely 
large sacral Tarlov cyst. Underlying soft tissue component can 
not be excluded and a MRI may be helpful in further evaluation. 
3. Degenerative changes as described above. 
4. Scattered areas of ground-glass opacity in bilateral lungs as 
well as areas of atelectasis and small right pleural effusion. 
Dedicated chest CT can be obtained for further evaluation if 
clinically warranted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ yo male w/ PMHx sig for atrial fibrillation 
on
___ transferred from ___ with R frontal and 
temporal DHs and R occipital IPH in the setting of 
supratheraputic INR, thought to be related from unknown trauma 
vs hypertension.  

# Subdural hematomas: The patient was found to have R frontal 
and temporal subdurals and R occipital IPH in the setting of 
supratherapeutic INR.  This was reversed with Vitamin K and FFP. 
  He was followed by NS, who determined that no surgical 
intervention was needed at this time and recommended that Keppra 
be started for seizure prophylaxis.  They had initially 
recommended restarting ASA, but given the extent of his bleeds 
and discussion with his family, it was decided to hold 
anticoagulation until further evaluation with NSG in 1 month.  
The patient continued to have L sided weakness and L hemineglect 
on transfer to the floor, so Neurology was consulted. A repeat 
MRI revealed no evidence of acute infarct and stable size of his 
bleeds.  They felt that his bleeds could explain his previous 
hemineglect.  On repeat examination, Neurology felt his hemi 
neglect had and did not feel further intervention was needed.

He is scheduled for NSG follow up in 1 month with repeat CT 
scan.
    
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a h/o afib, for which he 
was on Coumadin and Toprol 25mg PO daily. He had an episode of 
afib with RVR on ___, which responded well to Diltiazem 
10mg IV. His Toprol dose was increased to 50mg PO daily with 
good effect. HR on discharge 88.

# UTI: The patient had a UCx that showed infection with 
Enterococcus. The patient was started on a 14 day course of 
Ampicillin. He has 10 days remaining in his course.
   
# Severe AS/Pulm HTN: The patient had an ECHO, which showed 
severe aortic stenosis with valve area 0.8-1.0 cm2 and severe 
pulm HTN. He will need close follow up by his outpatient 
cardiologist, Dr. ___, ___
