Discharge Instructions:
Medications
You will be given a prescription for pain medicine.  The pain 
medication is a codeine derivative and should be taken as 
directed.  

Please take one full strength aspirin (325 mg) each day for six 
weeks to decrease the risk of having a complication related to a 
blood clot.

Please take a stool softener, like Colace (Docusate Sodium 
100mg), twice a day while taking narcotics to prevent 
constipation.

Dressing
Leave your dressing for 48 hours after your surgery.  After 48 
hours, you may remove your dressing.  LEAVE THE TAPE STRIPS OVER 
YOUR INCISIONS.  These will stay on for 1.5 to 2 weeks and will 
slowly peel off.

Showering
You may shower 48 hours after your surgery and get your 
incisions wet.  DO NOT immerse in a tub or pool for 7  10 days 
to avoid excessive scarring and risk of infection.

When you shower, let your arm hang at your side (Do NOT raise 
your arm).  

To wash under your arm, lean forward carefully and let your arm 
hang.  Using your other hand, wash under your operative arm.  Do 
NOT scrub the incision.  When you are done, stand up and let 
your arm hang at your side.  Pat yourself dry and put your sling 
on.

Ice Packs
Keep Ice Packs on at all times exchanging every hour while 
awake.  Icing is very important to decrease swelling and pain 
and improve mobility.  After 24 hours, continue to use the cuff 
3  4 times a day, 15  20 minutes each time to keep swelling to 
a minimum.

Activity
 Take it easy.
 Wear your sling for comfort and safety. 
 Keep your arm at your side at ALL TIMES  no reaching, 
grabbing or pulling with your operative arm.
