Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you! You came to us with 
stomach pain and worsening distension. While you were here we 
did a paracentesis to remove 1.5L of fluid from your belly. We 
also placed you on you 40 mg of Lasix and 50 mg of Aldactone to 
help you urinate the excess fluid still in your belly. As we 
discussed, everyone has a different dose of lasix required to 
make them urinate and it's likely that you weren't taking a high 
enough dose. Please take these medications daily to keep excess 
fluid off and eat a low salt diet. You will follow up with Dr. 
___ in liver clinic and from there have your colonoscopy 
and EGD scheduled. Of course, we are always here if you need us. 
We wish you all the best!
Your ___ Team.

# Goals of care:  The patient expressed that her desire to ""let 
go"" and be at peace. She is tired of ""fighting"" her end stage 
liver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of 
life. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice, 
which we were able to arrange, and she decided that she would 
like to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the 
patient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably 
be DNR/DNI, but would like to discuss it with her son (HCP). 
Therefore, at this time, she remains full code. We also 
discussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter 
placed because of her repeated paracenteses. She was discharged 
to home with hospice on ___.

# Decompensated HCV cirrhosis with ascites: The patient 
presented with worsening ascites. Her pain was initially managed 
with tramadol and morphine. She underwent ___ paracentesis 
on ___ with removal of 3.5L and she received albumin. Studies 
on the fluid were negative, and she reported a significant 
improvement in her pain.
 
# Hyperkalemia: During her hospitalization, it was noted that 
she had hyperkalemia 5.3 -> 5.9 -> 6.9 without EKG changes. 
After treatment with calcium gluconate 2gm x2, insulin and D50 x 
2, and kayexelate, her K downtrended to 5.4. Her K has been 
persistently elevated in the past and should continue to be 
monitored.

# Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status was A+Ox3 
on admission. She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose 
in-house and at discharge.

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============

# Hyponatremia - The patient has a history of asymptomatic 
hyponatremia. It is most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia 
related to underlying liver disease as well as aldosterone axis 
dysfunction related to liver disease. She remained asymptomatic 
through her hospitalization. Because she was also started on 
10mg of furosemide to help prevent fluid re-accumulation, she 
will require BMPs twice weekly in the outpatient setting.

# HIV: Emtricitabine-Tenofovir (Truvada) and Raltegravir were 
continued in-house and at discharge.  

# COPD: fluticasone, tiotropium and albuterol were continued 
in-house and at discharge.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[ ] Follow-up peritoneal fluid culture
[ ] New/changed medications: Furosemide 10mg daily (new)
[ ] For hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, the patient should have 
biweekly BMPs (script written). If K > 5.3, she should be given 
kayexelate once weekly. Lab results will be faxed/sent to Dr. 
___.
[ ] Continue conversation regarding pleurex catheter placement 
and code status.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at ___. You 
were admitted because of worsening abdominal pain. It is likely 
that this pain was due to increasing fluid in the abdomen from 
your cirrhosis. After a paracentesis in which much of this fluid 
was removed, your pain improved significantly. You were noted to 
have a high potassium during your hospitalization, which came 
down with treatment but this should continue to be followed as 
an outpatient. You also emphasized your desire to speak with a 
representative from hospice. Because of your repeated 
paracenteses, we also discussed the possibility of a pleurex 
catheter placement. We arranged for you to meet with hospice 
coordinators, and you will be discharged home with hospice.

We wish you all the best!

History of Present Illness:
___ male with ___ disease, dyslipidemia, and a
history of prostate cancer (s/p prostatectomy) who was referred
to the ED by his neurologist for worsening gait, falls, and
visual hallucinations. 

The following history is taken from chart review: 

The patient was seen by his neurologist on ___ at which time he
was noted to have visual hallucinations and worsening gait
freezing. For his gait freezing, his mirapex was increased by
0.125 mg every week to a goal dose of 0.75 mg t.i.d. He
successfully up-titrated the medicine to 0.75/0.625/0.625 but
began to have visual hallucinations and confusion so on ___ his
neurologist recommended decreasing the dose to 0.625 TID. 
Despite
the changes to his Mirapex, the patient's daughter has noted
progressive gait stiffness and increased difficulty standing.
This has resulted in difficulty with simply getting to the
bathroom leading to episodes of incontinence. A UA performed on
___ was reassuring. 

On the day of presentation to the hospital, the patient began to
experience visual hallucinations of a motor cross race in his
backyard. He subsequently had a fall while transferring from the
couch to a chair. His wife was unable to get him off the floor.
The fall was witnessed and there was no head strike. Per the
patient's wife, his gait has acutely worsened over the past 24
hours to the point where he has been unable to ambulate on his
own. The patient's daughter called his neurologist who
recommended presentation to the ED. 

In the ED, the patient was afebrile, HRs ___, normotensive, and
SpO2 100% RA. On exam he was noted to have cogwheeling of upper
extremities and decrease ___ strength. Labs were remarkable for a
negative urine and serum tox, Na 132, K 5.8 (hemolyzed and no 
EKG
changes), negative troponin, normal LFTs, unremarkable CBC. 
Chest
Xray showed no acute process and CTH was reassuring. He was
evaluated by neurology who recommended admission to medicine for
failure to thrive, to continue the patient's home medications,
and complete a toxo-metabolic workup. The patient was given his
home pramipexole and pravastatin before he was admitted.  

On arrival to the floor, the patient is comfortable in bed. He 
is
not accompanied by family on my interview. He knows that he is 
in
the hospital and that it is ___. He is not sure why he is here
and begins to tell me about a party in his house with a motor
cross race in his backyard. When I asked him about his fall, he
mentions that he has not had a fall for ___ years. He denies any
fevers, chills, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea,
diarrhea, or dysuria.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with history of factor VIII deficiency who 
presents with right neck swelling after snowboarding accident. 
The patient reports that he fell while snowboarding with loss of 
consciousness on ___. He was initially seen at 
___ where CT imaging of head/neck showed no 
intracranial hemorrhage. A CTA neck showed a thickened right 
platysma muscle with surrounding hematoma and a focus of active 
contrast extravasation within the right platysma muscle. He also 
developed a right shoulder hematoma although shoulder plain 
films didn't show acute abnormality. He was seen by ___ 
Hematology and gave him one dose of DDAVP IV. A factor VIII 
assay was 139 and vW level was >200 per report. Per report, his 
hemoglobin decreased from 13.2 on ___ to 11.6 on ___. 
Repeat imaging in the morning showed stable injuries. The 
patient saw his hematologist on ___ and was found to have a 
hemoglobin of 10.4. Because of the continued mild decrease, the 
patient followed up with his PCP ___ ___ at which time his 
hemoglobin was 9.9. He was found to have an enlarging flank 
hematoma, thus was referred given concern for retroperitoneal 
bleed. The patient has been using DDAVP intranasally 
intermittently since the accident. He denies lightheadedness or 
palpitations, any increase in neck swelling over the course of 
the week. He does endorse pain in his right shoulder ___ 
resting, ___ moving), though this has improved over the course 
of the week.  
In the ED, initial vital signs were 99.2 87 124/75 18 100%/RA. 
Initial labs demonstrated hemoglobin 10.6, though repeat was 
9.7. Chemistries and coags were unremarkable. FVIII activity was 
103. A CTAP was performed which demonstrated muscular hemorrhage 
along the flank, but no retroperitoneal bleed on preliminary 
read. The patient's outpatient hematologist, Dr. ___, was 
contacted and it was decided to give the patient desmopressin 
0.3mg/kg IV. The patient was then admitted for futher 
management.  
Per review of records, the patient has a history of significant 
bleeding after his circumcision, requiring blood transfusion. 
Throughout childhood, he also had a tendency to bruise easily. 
He was tested and found to have ___ disease. Later, 
after wisdom tooth extraction, the patient experienced late 
(e.g. ___ days later) bleeding despite treatment with DDAVP. The 
patient was retested by a hematologist associated with the 
___ and was diagnosed 
with hemophilia A. His FVIII activity has been checked on 
multiple occasions, sometimes testing normal, though has been as 
low as ~50.  
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient is comfortable without 
complaint.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is an ___ with history of AAA s/p repair 
complicated by MI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presents 
upon transfer from outside hospital with nasal fractures and 
epistaxis secondary to fall. The patient reports that he was at 
the ___ earlier this afternoon. While coughing, he tripped 
on the curb and suffered trauma to his face. He had no loss of 
consciousness. However, he had a persistent nosebleed and 
appeared to have some trauma to his face, thus was transferred 
to ___ for further care. There, a CT scan of 
the head, neck, and face were remarkable for a nasal bone and 
septal fracture. Given persistent epistaxis, bilateral 
RhinoRockets were placed. He had a small abrasion to the bridge 
of his nose which was not closed. Bleeding was well controlled. 
While in the OSH ED, he had an episode of nausea and coughed up 
some blood. At that time, he began to feel lightheaded and was 
noted to be hypotensive and bradycardic. Per report, he had a 
brief loss of consciousness, though quickly returned to his 
baseline. His family noted that his eyes rolled back into his 
head. The patient recalls the event and denies post-event 
confusion. He had no further episodes of syncope or hemodynamic 
changes.  Given the syncopal event and epistaxis, the patient 
was transferred for further care.

In the ED, initial vital signs 98.9 92 140/77 18 100%/RA. Labs 
were notable for WBC 11.3 (91%N), H/H 14.1/40.2, plt 147, BUN/Cr 
36/1.5. HCTs were repeated which were stable. A urinalysis was 
negative. A CXR demonstrated a focal consolidation at the left 
lung base, possibly representing aspiration or developing 
pneumonia. The patient was given Tdap, amoxicillin-clavulanate 
for antibiotic prophylaxis, ondansetron, 500cc NS, and 
metoprolol tartrate 50mg. Clopidogrel was held.

PA and lateral views of the chest provided. The lungs are 
adequately 
aerated. There is a focal consolidation at the left lung base 
adjacent to the lateral hemidiaphragm. There is mild vascular 
engorgement. There is bilateral apical pleural thickening. The 
cardiomediastinal silhouette is remarkable for aortic arch 
calcifications. The heart is top normal in size. 

___ ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal apical 
hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 
%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There 
are three aortic valve leaflets. There is mild aortic valve 
stenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild 
regional systolic dysfunction most c/w CAD (distal LAD 
distribution). Mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic 
regurgitation. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ with history of AAA s/p repair 
complicated by MI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who 
presented with nasal fractures and epistaxis after mechanical 
fall with hospital course complicated by NSTEMI.

#Epistaxis, nasal fractures
Patient presenting after mechanical fall with Rhinorockets 
placed at outside hospital for ongoing epistaxis. CT scan from 
that hospital demonstrated nasal bone and septal fractures. The 
Rhinorockets were maintained while inpatient and discontinued 
prior to discharge. He was encouraged to use oxymetolazone nasal 
spray and hold pressure should bleeding reoccur. 

#NSTEMI
Patient found to have mild elevation of troponin in the ED. This 
was trended and eventually rose to 1.5, though MB component 
downtrended during course of admission. The patient was without 
chest pain or other cardiac symptoms. Cardiology was consulted 
who thought that this was most likely secondary to demand 
ischemia (type II MI) secondary to his fall. An echocardiogram 
demonstrated aortic stenosis and likely distal LAD disease based 
on wall motion abnormalities. The patient's metoprolol was 
uptitrated, his pravastatin was converted to atorvastatin, his 
clopidogrel was maintained, and he was started on aspirin.

#Hypoxemia/L basilar consolidation
Patient reported to be mildly hypoxic in the ED, though he 
maintained normal oxygen saturations on room air. He denied 
shortness of breath or cough, fevers, or other infectious

Imaging
___ US abd/pelvis
IMPRESSION: 
1. Diffusely echogenic liver, suggestive of fatty infiltration. 
Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease 
including fibrosis and cirrhosis cannot be excluded. 
2. Layering sludge within the gallbladder, with mild gallbladder 
wall 
thickening, which may relate to underlying liver disease.  
3. Patent portal venous system. 
4. Moderate ascites. 
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. 


CT abd/pelvis ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Large volume ascites and enlarged edematous liver. The 
findings are 
suggestive of acute hepatitis.  
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

ECHO ___:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Transmitral and tissue 
Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no 
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic 
function. No diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension or 
pathologic valvular disease seen.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ woman with history of EtOH ___ years, 
heavy at times, with new onset liver failure and ascites.  
  
#  ASCITES/LFTs:  New onset ascites with SAAG supportive of 
portal hypertension.  Likely alcoholic hepatitis with ascites 
and possibility of cirrhosis.  Steroids and pentoxyphyline were 
deferred given her low discriminate factor.  In terms of other 
etiologies of liver disease, iron panel was not consistent with 
hemochromatosis, and ___, AMA, ___ were negative, making 
autoimmune causes unlikely.  Alpha 1 antitrypsin and 
ceruloplasmin were normal.  Viral studies show immunity to Hep B 
and A.  HIV was negative.  U/S and CT abd/pelvis were not 
suggestive of mass or obstructive lesions.  Patient received a 
2.5L paracentesis on ___, day prior to discharge.  Low-dose 
spironolactone was started.  Ms. ___ will follow-up with 
Dr. ___ in 1 week.
  
#  ALCOHOLISM:  On admission, alcohol level was 336 though 
patient was clinically sober.  Patient was monitored on a CIWA 
scale and treated with MVI, thiamine, and folate.  She was seen 
by social work and given the contact information for rehab 
facilities.  Although patient was encouraged to enter ___ 
rehab, she refused.  She will seek outpatient treatment for her 
addiction.  Ms. ___ was warned on multiple occasions that 
if she continues to drink she will irreperably destroy her liver 
and could even die.

#  BACK PAIN:  Patient was started on a lidocaine patch and 
given oxycodone for breakthrough pain while in the hospital.
  
#  LEUKOCYTOSIS:  Likely a combination of alcoholic hepatitis 
and UTI; patient was started on ciprofloxacin.  Other infectious 
work-up was unrevealing.  On day prior to discharge, patient 
spiked a fever to 101 and was pan cultured.  CXR was unrevealing 
and urine was negative for infection after the Cipro.  Ms. 
___ was discharged on levofloxacin for a 5 day course.
  
#  MACROCYTIC ANEMIA:  Likely from folate and nutritional 
deficiency in setting of alcoholism.  Patient was started on MV, 
thiamine, and folate supplementation.  HCT was monitored 
throughout admission.

#  ANXIETY:  Patient with marked anxiety.  She would likely 
benefit from outpatient therapy and/or SSRI treatment.

#  SINUS TACHYCARDIA:  Likely in context of decompensated liver 
disease.  ECHO was within normal limits.  Patient was monitred 
on telemetry throughout hospitalization.

#  CONSTIPATION:  Patient was maintained on senna and colace.
 
Medications on Admission:
None.

RADIOLOGY:
Lumbo-sacral XR: Normal, no evidence of osteomyelitis/vertebral

Brief Hospital Course:
#Abdominal distention/pain:
She was treated empirically due to concern for spontaneous 
bacterial peritonitis with ceftriaxone 2g x 1.  A diagnostic 
paracentesis was performed in the ED.  Ascitic fluid analysis 
was performed.  Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was ruled out 
given that the fluid cell count showed only 52 WBC; antibiotics 
were discontinued in this setting.  Subsequently, a large volume 
paracentesis was performed on ___ with 4.5L of fluids 
removed. After the procedure, her abdomen was less distended and 
less painful.  Fluid analysis again did not reveal SBP.  
.
#Alcoholic hepatitis:
Patient's liver synthetic function was monitored while 
hospitalized. She was maintained on her home regimen of 
lactulose. She also had 24-hr urine collection for copper to 
evaluate for ___ disease. 
.
#Leukocytosis and mild fever:
She had a temparature of 101 upon presentation in the ED.  She 
had no signs or symptoms of any infection.  Urine culture showed 
only GU flora, consistent with contamination. After arrival to 
the floor her temperature was stable, ranging from 99 to 101.  
Her WBC trended down throughout the hospitalization and was 11 
at the time of discharge.    
.
#Tachycardia:
Her heart rate was elevated in the 100-120s throughout the 
hospitalization. She had good oxygenation and had no complaints 
of SOB, dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations. The most likely 
etiology of this is pain, anxiety, and her low intravascular 
volume.  She was tachycardic in the 100s upon discharge.  
.
#Back pain:
Lumbosacral spine film revealed no skeletal abnormalities 
(vertebral compression fracture and osteomyelitis).  Her pain 
was present but well-controlled throughout the hospitalization 
with oxycodone ___ Q6H PRN pain.  Recommended follow up with 
her primary care provider to address management of her chronic 
pain. 
.

Discharge Instructions:
You were seen in the ___ Associates with 
complaints of increasing abdominal distention and pain. In the 
clinic, you also had a mild fever, fast heart rate, and 
increased white blood count.  You were sent to the emergency 
department and admitted to the hospital for further workup.  
During the hospitalization your ascitic fluid was tapped and 
analyzed.  The result showed that you did not have an infection 
of the ascitic fluid.  Subsequently, fluid was removed from your 
abdomen via paracentesis. We also started a 24-hr urine 
collection for copper to work up for other potential causes of 
your liver disease.  The liver clinic will follow up with you 
regarding the results of these tests.  
.
Your back pain persisted during your hospitalization.  You 
underwent x-rays which showed no evidence of fracture or bone 
infection.  Please continue your home pain regimen and readdress 
with your primary care provider.
.
No changes were made to your home medications.  You should 
continue to use lactulose for constipation while using pain 
medications.  
.
Please stop using all herbal or tonic remedies until your liver 
function has recovered. Some of these therapies may interact 
with your current medications or make it difficult to interpret 
your laboratory results.

CT abdomen/pelvis
1. Innumerable hepatic and pulmonary metastases.  No obvious 
primary 
malignancy is identified on this study. 
  
2. No evidence of small bowel obstruction, ischemic colitis, 
fluid collection, 
or perforation. 

CXR: 
 
New nodular opacities within both upper lobes, left greater than 
right. 
Findings are compatible with metastases, as was noted in the 
lung bases on the 
subsequent CT of the abdomen and pelvis performed later the same 
day. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ Female with PMH significant for depression, 
hyperlipidemia, Hysterectomy, B12 deficiency, OA, carcinoid, 
cervical DJD, depression, SBO who presented with nausea, 
vomiting, weakness x 2 weeks and was found to have multiple 
liver and lung masses per CT consistent with metastatic cancer 
of unknown primary. 

Patient was treated with IV fluids overnight for dehydration. 
She refused to stay in the hospital for any further work-up or 
treatment and stated she would rather go home to to think and 
see to her affairs over the weekend and consider pursuing 
further work-up as an outpatient. She tolerated oral fluids well 
w/o vomiting. She remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile 
throughout her stay. 

Of note patient has psychiatric history of depressive symptoms 
and isolation tendencies. She denied any SI/SA or any risk to 
herself.  She has little social supports but does have a good 
relationship with her driver and friend who came in and was 
updated by the medical team on the morning of discharge and will 
be taking her home. She sees a mental health provider at ___ 
once a month and has a good relationship with her primary care 
physician. Patient was dischaerged home at her request. Home 
medications were continued to which we added some symptomatic 
treatment for her cough with benzonatate and Guaifenesin. We 
held off on anti-emetics for now as she did not want to stay 
inhouse to make sure these would be well tolerated (would need 
to monitor for drug interactions given multiple QTc prolonging 
and serotonergic medications on her home meds).  She was 
instructed to maintain good hydration and try a soft diet at 
home if she can not tolerate regular diet. The patient met with 
SW who provided her with resources for community councelling. 
Outpatient appointments with oncology, GI and her PCP were set 
up and her PCP and mental health provider were updated. Her PCP 
___ also ___ with her later today by telephone.

Final Report 
HISTORY:  New diagnosis of metastatic cancer with unknown 
primary.  Assess for extent of lesions.   
COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis dated ___.  
TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT of the torso was performed with 
intravenous and oral contrast.  Coronal and sagittal 
reformations were provided.  Images are substantially degraded 
due to the patient's body habitus.   
FINDINGS: 
CHEST:  
There are innumerable pulmonary nodules, which have an upper 
lobe 
predilection, particularly in the left upper lobe.  The largest 
nodule 
measures 6 mm in diameter (sequence 3 image 8).  Calcification 
is noted within  the right pleural cavity (sequence 3 image 24), 
which is likely related to the patient's history of previous 
right lung surgery.  No pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  
No significant mediastinal, axillary or hilar adenopathy.  
Cardiac size is 
normal.  No pericardial effusion.  
ABDOMEN:  
The liver is enlarged and there are innumerable ___ density 
lesions throughout both lobes of the liver which are replacing 
the vast majority of the hepatic parenchyma.  The portal vein is 
patent.  No intra or extrahepatic duct dilatation.  The 
gallbladder is unremarkable.  There is a small amount of ascites 
adjacent to the right lobe of the liver.   
  
The right kidney is mildly compressed anteriorly due to the 
enlarged liver. There is a subcentimeter ___ density lesion in 
the upper pole of the right kidney, likely representing a 
subcentimeter cyst (sequence 5 image 31).  The right kidney is 
otherwise unremarkable.  The left kidney is within normal 
limits.  The adrenals and spleen are unremarkable.  The pancreas 
is within normal limits.  The small and large bowel are 
unremarkable.  No retroperitoneal or mesenteric adenopathy.  
  
PELVIS:  
The images of the pelvis are substantially degraded secondary to 
the patient's body habitus.  No pelvic masses are identified.  
The bladder is unremarkable.  The patient is status post 
supracervical hysterectomy.  No pelvic adenopathy. No free fluid 
within the pelvis.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ for evaluation of several weeks of 
weakness and nausea. You had some markers of infection, so you 
were initially given antibiotics. However, a scan of your torso 
showed metastatic disease from a cancer of unknown origin in 
your liver and lungs. Your weakness and nausea are most likely 
due to your enlarged liver. 

You are scheduled to see your oncologist this week, so please 
follow-up with them so that they may proceed with the further 
diagnosis and treatment of your malignancy.

You are being discharged to a rehabilitation facility to help 
you regain some strength before going home. Your anticipated 
length of stay is LESS THAN 30 DAYS. 

Please see the attached sheet for your updated medication list. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital. We wish

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with metastatic cancer of unknown primary 
(known lesions in lungs and liver) presenting with shortness of 
breath. She initially presented to ___ in ___ with abdominal 
pain and failure to thrive. Evaluation at that time included an 
abdominal CT scan that showed multiple lung and liver 
metastases. She has yet to undergo definite diagnosis with 
biopsy, and per recent oncology documentation seems disengaged 
with care.  
She was reportedly in her usual state of health until the 
evening prior to admission, when she developed acute on chronic 
shortness of breath while at rest. She reported midsternal chest 
ache associated with this shortness of breath. Pain is 
exacerbated by direct pressure; nothing seems to alleviate pain. 
She denied any pleuritic or exertional component to the chest 
pain or shortness of breath. She feels that symptoms are 
secondary to her ""cancer"" and ""feels as if the cancer has 
spread"". She reports stable, chronic nonproductive cough, which 
has been present over the preceding months.  
She was seen recently in the ED for evaluation of left greater 
than right lower extremity edema with lower extremity venous 
ultrasounds negative, without change in edema since since that 
visit. She denies associated fever, chills, sweats, PND, 
orthopnea, or positional component to pain. 
In the ED, initial vital signs were: 98.0 116 100/49 24 99% RA. 
Labs notable for leukocytosis to 17.9, hematocrit of 32, and 
lactate of 2.8. Urinalysis was positive, but with 19 epithelial 
cells. CTA was negative for central pulmonary embolus, focal 
consolidation, or pleural effusion, though did reveal 
innumerable pulmonary nodules, as well as enlarged liver with 
stable metastases. EKG was interpreted as sinus tachycardia and 
was overall consistent with prior. Ceftriaxone/azithromycin were 
initiated for possible pneumonia. Vital signs on  transfer were 
as follows: 97.9 107 100/60 22 100% RA. On arrival to the floor, 
she reports that shortness of breath has improved and that she 
is chest pain free.

Microbiology:
Blood x2 (___): No growth
Urine (___): No growth
Blood x2 (___): No growth

Pathology:
Liver biopsy (___):
Liver, core needle biopsy (A):
Adenocarcinoma, involving the liver (see note).
Note: Immunohistochemical stains are performed.  The tumor cells 
are positive for CK20 and CDX-2, and negative for CK7 and TTF-1. 
 These results are consistent with metastasis from a colorectal 
primary.

Imaging:
EKG (___):
Sinus tachycardia. Low voltage. Diffuse non-specific 
repolarization
abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ 
repolarization
abnormalities are slightly more prominent.
___
___

Portable CXR (___):
Innumerable pulmonary metastases.  Possible mild pulmonary 
vascular
congestion.  Low lung volumes.

CTA (___):
1.  No central or segmental filling defect in the pulmonary 
arteries.
Evaluation is slightly limited due to suboptimal IV bolus. 
2.  Innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules, simas seen on the 
prior CT study on ___, slightly increased.  No focal 
consolidation or pleural effusion.  
3.  Enlarged liver with multiple hypodense lesions, with 
suggestion of
increased burden of disease.

Right upper quadrant ultrasound (___):
Extensive diffuse hepatic metastatic disease.  No evidence of 
biliary duct
obstruction.

Portable CXR (___):
1. Low lung volumes and mild pulmonary vascular congestion is 
unchanged. 
2. New small right fissural pleural effusion.
3. No new focal opacities to suggest pneumonia.  

Noncontrast head CT (___):
No acute intracranial process.  No mass is identified.  MRI is 
more sensitive for evaluation of metastases.

Left hip XR (___):
No definite lytic lesion; however, an MRI can be performed to 
evaluate for an osseous lesion if indicated.

Portable abdomen (___):
Radiographs of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrate a 
nonobstructed
bowel gas pattern.  A relative paucity of bowel gas is present 
in the upper and mid abdomen, likely due to marked enlargement 
of the liver, displacing bowel loops.  Note that the upright 
view is technically suboptimal, and limits evaluation for free 
intraperitoneal air.  If free intraperitoneal air is suspected 
clinically, a left lateral decubitus view of the abdomen would 
be recommended.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with metastatic cancer of unknown primary, 
including lesions in the liver and lungs, who initially 
presented with shortness of breath, likely due to worsening 
intrapulmonary tumor burden, and later underwent percutaneous 
liver biopsy with pathology consistent with metastatic colon 
cancer, prompting transfer to the oncology service and 
eventually discharged home with hospice.

Active Issues:
(1) Metastatic colon adenocarcinoma: CTA to exclude pulmonary 
embolus and right upper quadrant ultrasound on admission 
demonstrated progression of previously recognized metastatic 
cancer of unknown primary involving the liver and lungs, which 
had evaded diagnosis in the outpatient setting due to patient 
reluctance to engage with care. Percutaneous liver biopsy 
ultimately revealed primary colonic adenocarcinoma. Following 
discussion with her outpatient oncology providers, she was 
transferred to the inpatient oncology service for potential 
trial of FLOX. However, given the patient's very poor functional 
and nutritional status a goals of care discussion was held with 
the patient's HCP, ___ and it was decided to focus 
goals of care of comfort and symptom management and the patient 
was discharged home with home hospice. 

(2) Left thigh weakness/spinous tenderness: She was found to 
have focal left thigh weakness in association with diffuse 
spinous tenderness of unclear chronicity in the setting of 
preserved rectal tone without saddle anesthesia. She was noted 
to be incontinent of urine, but not feces. Given underlying 
malignancy, there was concern for bony metastases or cord 
involvement, with alternative consideration given to epidural 
abscess, prompting transient initiation of empiric antibiotic 
coverage with vancomycin/cefepim ___ to ___. Despite 
frequent persuasive efforts, she declined multiple attempts at 
lumbosacral MRI, including with lorazepam premedication, citing 
claustrophobia. Neuro exam was monitored and remained stable.

(3) Abdominal pain: She experienced intermittent abdominal pain 
and tenderness without peritoneal signs, concerning for 
obstruction in the setting of intraabdominal malignancy, 
particularly given episodes of emesis/hematemesis as below. 
While multiple KUBs were negative for obstruction, CT abdomen 
was planned to evaluate for alternative sources of 
intraabdominal pathology, but she declined on multiple 
occasions. Pain was controlled with acetaminophen and tramadol 
as needed.

(4) ? Hematemesis: She experienced a single episode of small 
volume emesis, reportedly approximately 100cc, streaked with 
blood and found to be guiac positive. Vital signs and hematocrit 
remained stable. IV pantoprazole was initiated for 
gastrointestinal prophylaxis, with subsequent discontinuation of 
PPI given no recurrence and questionable if first episode was 
true blood vs. red popsicle was eating at time. 
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was deferred in the absence of 
recurrent hematemesis; no prior EGDs were available in OMR. 

(5) Altered mental status: She was intermittently altered 
throughout admission, never oriented to more than person and 
place, with occasional difficulty following simple commands as 
compared to an uncertain baseline. Infectious work up, including 
blood and urine cultures and CTA on admission with subsequent 
CXRs, was unrevealing. Noncontrast head CT was negative for 
acute intracranial process. Brain MRI for definitive exclusion 
of metastases could not be obtained due to claustrophobia/MRI 
aversion as above.  ABG on ___ without signs of CO2 retention. 
History of opiates making patient sleepy per HCP as possible 
contributing factor and therefore these were discontinued. 
Hepatic encephalopathy also on differential given metastatic 
lesions to liver and asterixis on exam.  AMS could also be ___ 
to severe depression. Mental status monitored and remained 
stable and patient at baseline per HCP on discharge.

(6) Shortness of breath: She presented with acute onset 
shortness of breath without frank hypoxia. CTA on admission was 
negative for pulmonary embolus, though (subsegmental clot could 
not be excluded definitively), pleural effusion, or focal 
infiltrate. EKG and cardiac enzymes were reassuring against 
acute coronary syndrome.  Low voltages on EKG were consistent 
with prior, hence limited suspicion for pericardial effusion. 
Shortness of breath resolved over the course of admission 
without dedicated treatment, with the exception of nebulizers 
and expectorants as needed.

(7) Leukocytosis: White blood cell count was elevated and peaked 
at 20.6, consistent with recent baseline, likely reflecting 
underlying malignancy. As noted above, infectious work up 
including CTA, urine and blood cultures, and CXRs, was 
unrevealing. She remained afebrile, with the exception of 
isolated transient fever to 100, with stable vital signs. 

(8 )Liver function test abnormalities: AST remained elevated ___ 
to ___, alkaline phosphatase 260s to 380s, and total bilirubin 
2.1 to 2.6, likely due to hepatic infiltration of malignancy. 
Right upper quadrant ultrasound was negative for cholecystitis 
or obstructive process. The possibility of superimposed 
intraabdominal process, such as infection, could not be excluded 
in the setting of abdominal pain with emesis as above, but she 
declined CT for further evaluation.

(9) Elevated lactate: Lactate was found to be 2.7-3.8 throughout 
admission despite copious IV fluids, likely reflecting 
compromised hepatic clearance in the setting of malignant 
infiltration. 

(10) Sinus tachycardia: She remained persistently tachycardic 
100s to 115s throughout admission in the setting of poor PO 
intake, but incompletely responsive to copious IV fluids. 
Tachycardia has been present since at least ___. Despite 
concurrent leukocytosis and elevated lactate, there was no clear 
infectious source, hence low suspicion for sepsis. Subsegmental 
pulmonary embolus could not be excluded on the basis of 
admission CTA, but shortness of breath was short lived, and she 
was never hypoxic. Hematocrit remained stable without signs of 
active bleeding, with the exception of transient hematemesis as 
above.

(11) Depression: She appeared depressed with flat affect and 
seeming anhedonia throughout admission, with underlying 
depression likely affecting motivation to seek diagnosis and 
treatment of known malignancy. She denied active suicidal 
ideation and frequently declined home sertraline, particularly 
prior to liver biopsy, believing that it was supposed to be held 
preprocedurally despite explanation to the contrary. She was 
seen by social work throughout admission.

(12) Normocytic anemia: Hematocrit remained stable and 
consistent with recent baseline at 27 to 33 throughout 
admission, seemingly due to anemia of chronic disease on the 
basis of preadmission labs. Vital signs remained stable, with 
the exception of persistent tachycardia, without signs of active 
bleeding apart from isolated blood streaked emesis as above.

(13) Coagulopathy: INR of 1.2 to 1.8 was felt to reflect 
synthetic dysfunction in the setting of hepatic infiltration of 
malignancy, as well as poor oral intake. There were no signs of 
active bleeding, with the exception of transient hematemesis as 
above.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure taking part in your care during your admission 
to ___. As you know, you were 
admitted for shortness of breath, likely due to your underlying 
cancer, and there was no evidence of pneumonia or blood clot in 
the blood vessels of your lungs. Your shortness of breath 
resolved, but you were found to have weakness in your left thigh 
and abdominal pain. You declined imaging studies for further 
investigation of these findings. You underwent biopsy of your 
liver that revealed that the cancer known to affect your liver 
and lungs originated in your colon (large bowel). You were 
transferred to the oncology service, but unfortunately 
chemotherapy would do more harm for you than good.  After a long 
discussion with you and your health care proxy, it was decided 
that you will go home to be with your family and loved ones.  We 
will also set up hospice services for you so that they can help 
with any issues that arise while you are at home.

ECG ___  7:56:06 ___  
Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. The Q-T interval is 400 
milliseconds. Q waves in leads V1-V2 with ST-T wave 
abnormalities extending to lead V6. Consider prior anterior 
myocardial infarction. Since the previous tracing of ___ 
atrial premature beats are not seen. The Q-T interval is 
shorter. ST-T wave abnormalities are less prominent.  
 
CXR ___:
PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes. 
Tiny bilateral pleural effusions are new since ___. No 
signs of pneumonia or pulmonary vascular congestion. Heart is 
top normal in size though this is stable. Aorta is markedly 
tortuous, unchanged. Aortic arch calcifications are seen. There 
is no pneumothorax. No focal consolidation. Partially imaged 
upper abdomen is unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Tiny pleural effusions, new. Otherwise unremarkable.

ECHO ___:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity 
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 
>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch 
levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully 
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of 
mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate 
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic 
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting 
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is an anterior 
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular 
cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular 
systolic function. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Mild-moderate 
mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the 
severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are increased and 
moderate PA hypertension is now identified.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ woman with h/o hypertension, hypelipidemia, diabetes 
mellitus on insulin, cerebellar-medullary stroke in ___, 
stage ___ CKD followed by Dr ___ presenting with fatigue and 
DOE for a few weeks, markedly worse the morning of admission. 
The patient has known diastolic dysfunction. Of note, she has 
been noncompliant with her medications at home. On arrival to 
the floor, she required hydralazine 20 mg to bring down her BP. 
She has likely had elevated BPs at home for a while, which is 
contributing to her SOB, CHF exacerbation, and secondary demand 
myonecrosis (hypertensive urgency) with mildly elevated 
troponin.

# CAD: Although she did not have a classic anginal presentation, 
patient has several risk factors for acute coronary syndrome. 
Her only symptom was SOB in the setting of elevated BPs 
attributed to medication noncompliance at home. Her troponin 
fell from 0.05 at admission to 0.01 at discharge in the setting 
of renal dysfunction, but there was not a clear rise and fall to 
suggest an acute infarction from plaque rupture and thrombosis. 
She was scheduled for an outpatient stress test to evaluate for 
evidence of ischemia from flow-limiting CAD. We decreased ASA to 
81 mg from 325 mg daily to decrease the risk of bleeding. Her 
LDL was found to be 146. We wanted to change her from 
simvastatin to the more potent atorvastatin (and avoid issues 
with drug-drug interactions), but her insurance would not cover 
atorvastatin. She was therefore switched to pravastatin 80 mg at 
discharge. From a cardiac standpoint, we did not feel that 
Plavix was necessary for CAD, but her neurologist was contacted 
and wanted Plavix continued. We had to stop metoprolol due to HR 
in the ___ during admission even off metoprolol.
  
# Pump: Last echo in ___ showed low normal LVEF. Her current 
presentation was consistent with CHF exacerbation with bilateral 
pleural effusions, dyspnea, and elevated NT-Pro-BNP. Her TTE 
showed mild-moderate mitral and moderate tricuspid 
regurgitation, LVEF 50-55%, and pulmonary hypertension. We 
changed her HCTZ to Lasix 40 mg PO at discharge. This medication 
can be uptitrated as needed.

# Hypertension: The patient's nephrologist, Dr. ___, agreed 
with our proposed medication adjustments, but recommended 
staying away from clonidine. There has been a H/O medication 
non-adherence. Social work was involved in discharge planning, 
and ___ will be assisting the patient at home. We added 
lisinopril 20 mg daily, Lasix 40 mg daily and continued 
nifedipine 120 mg daily. Her atenolol was stopped due to her 
renal dysfunction, but her metoprolol had to be stopped due to 
bradycardia. She should continue on once a day medication dosing 
to help with compliance.

# ? COPD: The patient may have a component of COPD as she was 
wheezing on admission and responded to albuterol. She was given 
a prescription for albuterol prn.

Transitional Issues:
- She will be scheduled for outpt stress stress test
- She has follow-up appointments with Dr. ___ and Dr. 
___ and both can work on uptitrating her BP 
meds as needed.
- ___ will need to work with patient on medication compliance.

CXR: ___
Right upper lobe pneumonia or mass.  However, given right hilar 
fullness, a mass resulting in post-obstructive pneumonia is 
within the 
differential.  Recommend chest CT with intravenous contrast for 
further 
assessment. 

TTE: ___
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild 
to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
near-akinesis of the inferior, inferolateral and basal lateral 
segments. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 
35-40%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric jet 
of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There 
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. 
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
regional LV wall motion abnormalities are new. Severity of 
mitral regurgitation has increased.

CARDIAC CATH: ___
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system 
revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no 
obstructive disease.  The LAD had a moderate disease in the mid 
artery and a diagonal branch had an 80% proximal lesion.  The 
Lcx had a 70% proximal lesion.  The RCA was totally occluded 
mid-vessel. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Recommend CABG evaluation

CT CHEST: ___
1.  Diffuse confluent ground-glass opacities predominantly in 
the right upper lobe and right lower lobe most likely represent 
residual pulmonary edema, localized to the right lung because of 
direction of jet in mitral 
regurgitation.  
2.  Possible pulmonary hypertension. 
3.  Moderate coronary artery disease. 

CAROTID US: ___
No evidence of hemodynamically significant internal carotid 
stenosis on either side. 

ECHO ___- PCI)
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with inferior and infero-lateral hypokinesis. No 
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no 
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. An eccentric jet of mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the LVEF has increased. The degree of MR seen has decreased. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with ___, HTN, diabetes, CKD presented with 
increased dyspnea and non-productive cough without fevers or 
elevated white count, initially admitted to ___ with concern 
for pneumonia. However, was found to have ST-changes, enzyme 
leak, new wall motion abnormality consistent with a recent 
cardiac event and had no evidence of pneumonia (no fevers, wbc, 
lactate, normal vitals, CXR with likely one sided pulmonary 
edema from mitral regurgitation). She was seen by cardiology who 
transferred the patient to cardiology floor.

# Acute systolic CHF exacerbation/mitral regurgitation: 
Likely secondary to ischemic valvular disease resulting in 
worsening mitral regurgitation. ECHO also with akinetic inferior 
wall segments, which also supports an ischemic event. Cardiac 
cath revealed 3 vessel disease. Patient was managed medically 
with lasix, lisinopril, and metoprolol. Cardiac surgery was 
consulted for possible CABG and mitral valve repair/replacement. 
However, given her multiple comorbidities, she is extremely high 
risk and surgery was deferred. Therefore, the decision was made 
to revascularize the patient with PCI to see if the patient 
would regain function of her mitral valve. Patient received a 
bare metal stent in the LCx and plain old balloon angioplasty in 
the diagonal artery. Repeat echo showed improvement of her 
mitral regurgitation. 

# NSTEMI/CAD:
As evidenced by EKG changes and troponin leak. Patient was 
briefly started on a heparin drip prior to her first cardiac 
catheterization. As above, cardiac catheterization revealed 
3-vessel disease. Patient was initially medically managed with 
aspirin, plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. As 
the patient would be too high risk for CABG, patient returned to 
the cath lab and had a bare metal stent and POBA. She will 
require plavix for at least 1 month.

# Hypertension: Patient remained normotensive. Continued 
nifedipine at half of her home dose. Continued on lisinopril. 
She was also started on metoprolol as above for CHF.

# Diabetes: Continued home insulin regime. 
 
# CKD stage IV: Baseline Cr 2.5-2.8 per renal notes. Currently 
at baseline. 

# History of CVA: Continued home aspirin and clopidogrel. 

# GERD: Continued home ranitidine.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
* Will need follow up with a cardiologist. Patient will be 
scheduled to follow up with the first available CMED 
cardiologist. 
* Will need plavix for at least one month (day of bare metal 
stent placement = ___.
* Atorvastatin dose increased to 80mg (per pharmacy, her 
insurance will cover. Her co-pay will be $10/month).
* Consider titrating nifedipine dose back to 120mg if still 
hypertensive. 
* Please recheck Chem7 at next appointment to evaluate for ___ 
secondary to dye received during cardiac catheterization.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. As you recall, you were admitted for shortness 
of breath. This was because one of your heart valves was weak, 
which caused fluid to build up in your lungs. Your heart valve 
was weak because there was a blockage in one of your heart 
arteries. You underwent a procedure, called cardiac 
catheterization, which opened up the blocked arteries. Your 
valve and heart are pumping much more efficiently now. We are 
glad you are feeling better. Please weigh yourself every 
morning, and call your MD if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs 
over 24 hours.

shortness of breath and substernal chest tightness since ___ 
evening. 

Patient notes that ___ evening had a large seafood dinner 
which is not usual for her, and then later around 10pm had acute 
onset of SOB feeling like she could not take deep breaths with 
chest tightness (patient notes this is her ""angina""). Denies 
pleuritic component to CP, described as central and across lower 
rib cage, persistent since onset, no radiation to the 
shoulders/jaw/back, no diaphoreses. Worsens with activity, 
improves somewhat with rest. Patient does not it feels like 
other episodes when she then required her stent placement. Took 
a SLNx1, which improved her symptoms though these persisted, but 
almost immediately led to abdominal discomfort with vomiting x1, 
nonbloody with dinner pieces. ___, 1 day prior to admission, 
decided to see if her pain improved on its own, then when it 
persisted on ___, husband arranged for UC appt at ___ 
___. At PCP, ___, SBP up to 200s, EKG with ST 
depressions in the precordial leads, specifically V3, V4 and V5, 
given full dose ASA and SLNx1, and sent to the ED given concern 
for ACS versus HTN emergency. 

Patient reporting baseline sleeps with 2 pillows, unchanged 
recently, no cough, PND, orthopnea with 2 pillows. Worsening DOE 
since onset of symptoms, now unable to complete a block where 
she used to be able to walk a few blocks at a time without 
stopping ___ SOB/CP. Denies new ___ edema (baseline says L leg > 
R).

Also had emesis last night x 1; no diaphoresis, no chest pain, 
no radiation of symptoms anywhere. No diarrhea or constipation, 
no dysuria, no focal weakness/numbness. On ROS, also with some L 
leg tingling intermittently, stable and chronic. Had diarrhea x1

then. 
 
In the ED initial vital signs; T 98 P 88 BP 190/120 R 18 O2 Sat 
98% 3L nasal cannula. Labs notable for Cr 2.1 (baseline 
2.1-2.7), BUN 29. wbc 4.3, H/H 8.6/26.0, Plt 147. Initial and 
rpt Tn <0.01. BNP 4279. CXR showed no pulmonary edema, pleural 
effusions, or consolidation, borderline cardiomegaly. The 
patient received carvedilol, nebulizers, and IV lasix. It is 
unclear how much UOP the patient has as it was not documented in 
the ED. 

The patient was seen by cardiology in the ED who felt that in 
the setting of systolic heart failure, her dyspnea was likely 
due to a CHF exacerbation in the setting of dietary 
indiscretion. Diuresis was recommended in addition to increasing 
carvedilol to 12.5mg BID, as well as a nuclear stress test this 
morning.

On the floor, the patient c/o of some improved dyspnea/chest 
tightness as well as wheezing (no COPD/asthma history, no 
significant smoking history), but otherwise has no acute 
complaints. Given her continued SOB and wheezing, she was 
written for nebulizers and steroids for reactive airway disease 
overnight.

==== IMAGING ====

___ CHEST (PA AND LAT):
The lungs are clear of consolidation, effusion, or edema. 
Cardiac silhouette is top normal. Descending thoracic aorta is 
tortuous with atherosclerotic calcification seen at the arch. No 
acute osseous abnormalities identified. 
IMPRESSION:  
No acute cardiopulmonary process.

___ P-MIBI:
Clinical Indication: SS CHEST TIGHTNESS ASSESS FOR EVIDENCE OF 
ISCHEMIA  
HISTORY: ___ yo woman with a history of CAD and CHF referred for 
evaluation of chest pain and dyspnea.

SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB: 
For pharmacologic coronary vasodilatation dipyridamole was 
infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142 
milligram/kilogram/min. She had no anginal symptoms or ischemic 
ECG changes.

TECHNIQUE: 
ISOTOPE DATA: (___) 11.0 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Rest; 
(___) 29.6 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress; DRUG DATA: (Non-NM 
admin) Dipyridamole;

IMAGING METHOD:
Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi. 
Tracer was injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining 
the resting images. 
Following resting images and following intravenous infusion, 
approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-99m sestamibi 
was administered intravenously. Stress images were obtained 
approximately 30 minutes following tracer injection. 
Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT. 
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial 
perfusion model. 

FINDINGS: 
The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and 
breast attenuation.
Left ventricular cavity size is increased.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake 
throughout the left ventricular myocardium. 
Gated images reveal normal wall motion. 
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 59% with an 
EDV of 117 ml.

IMPRESSION:
1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 
2. Increased left ventricular cavity size with normal systolic 
function.
Compared with prior study of ___, the cavity size is 
larger.
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with history of HTN, CVA, CAD (s/p BMS to 
circumflex in ___, CHF (EF 45% in ___ who presented 
with acute onset shortness of breath and substernal chest 
tightness.

# Shortness of breath:
Patient with acute onset SOB following seafood meal with 
associated chest tightness (see below). Patient with crackles 
and expiratory rhonchi on lung exam. CXR did not show 
significant pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, or consolidation 
although her BNP was elevated. Per pharmacy records, patient had 
not refilled lasix prescription since ___. Overall, 
presentation was most consistent with a mild CHF exacerbation. 
She received treatment with IV lasix and her shortness of breath 
subsequently improved quickly. She was able to be transitioned 
to a PO regimen of lasix 40mg qday on ___ (day of discharge). 
Dry weight on day of discharge was 75.9kg.

# Chest Tightness:
Patient reported chest tightness associated with her shortness 
of breath. Was given aspirin and SL nitroglycerin in her PCP's 
office prior to being directed to the ED. Troponin was negative 
x2. EKG without evidence of acute ischemia. Due to her 
significant CAD history, she underwent a P-MIBI on ___ which 
was unremarkable. Her chest tightness was thought to be of 
non-cardiac etiology.

# HTN:
Patient presented with SBP of 190-200. Cardiology was consulted 
and recommended increasing her carvedilol from 6.25mg BID to 
12.5mg BID. With this change, and continuation of her other home 
medications, her blood pressure decreased to systolics in range 
of 110-146 on day of discharge. It is unclear whether her very 
elevated BP on admission was occurring in the setting of 
medication non-compliance. Nifedipine was decreased from BID to 
daily given increased carvedilol and addition of Lasix (which 
patient was believed to have been non-compliant with prior to 
this admission).

==== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ====

Outpatient Providers: ___ with PMHx significant for CAD, HTN, 
HLD, T2DM, CKD stage IV, PVD (s/p in ___, left superficial 
femoral artery), presents with lower left leg numbness and pain, 
found to have bilateral unprovoked DVT. She was treated with a 
heparin drip and had many bleeding events during her stay: she 
developed an upper GIB, had an EGD, and was followed by GI 
during her admission. The heparin drip was stopped and then 
re-started once her coffee-ground emesis resolved. Her stools 
were guiac positive, however no active blood was found on rectal 
exam. GI felt that colonoscopy could be deferred to out patient. 
Additionally she developed a left arm hematoma. The heparin drip 
was stopped and then re-started once her hematoma was felt to be 
stable. She had left radial as well as bilateral lower extremity 
___ dopplerable pulses throughout admission. Hematology was 
consulted after the patient developed a left arm hematoma and 
the drip was slowly uptitrated as per their recommendations. She 
was successfully bridged to coumadin with an INR on discharge of 
2.0. She was discharged to rehab as per ___ recs.

================================================================

___ y/o female with PMHx significant for CAD, HTN, HLD, T2DM, CKD 
stage IV, PVD (s/p in ___, left superficial femoral artery), 
presented with lower Left leg numbness and pain since yesterday 
evening, with ultrasound bilateral lower extremities showing 
bilateral posterior tibial veins DVT's.

# Unprovoked Bilateral DVTs: No clinical signs of PE on 
admission or during stay, positive bilateral DVTs on LENIs. Pain 
and swelling improved on anticoagulation. Patient was bridged 
with heparin drip to therapeutic warfarin with INR goal ___. Due 
to continually supratherapeutic PTT > 150 on heparin drip, 
hematology was consulted and no further workup was deemed 
necessary. Heparin drip was carefully uptitrated as needed. 
Clopidogrel was stopped per outpatient cardiologist. Patient 
will need age-appropriate cancer screening including colonoscopy 
and mammogram. Patient will follow-up in ___ clinic for 
anticoagulation management and should continue on warfarin for 
at least 3 months. 

# Upper GI bleed: Patient developed 1 episode large coffee 
ground emesis while on heparin drip with PTT > 150. Received 2U 
pRBCs. GI consulted and EGD showed gastritis and superficial 
erosions but no active bleeding. Incidental finding of medium 
sized hiatal hernia. Stool h. pylori antigen was negative. GI 
recommended 8 weeks of high dose PPI.

# Left antecubital hematoma: Patient developed large left 
antecubital hematoma in setting of phlebotomy and PTT > 150 on 
heparin gtt. Heparin gtt held while hematoma improved. Repeat 
h/h were stable. 

# Acute on CKD Stage IV: Patient with creatinine of 2.9 on 
admission with baseline 2.0-2.5. Improved with hydration. Home 
lasix and lisinopril were initially held. Home lasix restarted 
on discharge at 20mg daily. 

# Normocytic Anemia: Patient has normocytic anemia. Rectal exam 
in ED was guaiac negative. In past treated with aransep as well 
as EPO. Etiology likely related to underlying CKD, however also 
must consider slow GI bleed (patient has gastritis/duodenitis on 
EGD but no evidence of active bleeding. Iron studies were 
normal. 

# HFpEF: Home furosemide and Lisinopril were held on admission 
for ___ followed by GI bleed. Carvedilol and nifedine were held 
in setting of GIB (see above). Nifedipine was restarted at 30mg 
bid and lasix was decreased from 40mg to 20mg daily.

# CAD: hx of MI in ___ BMS to circumflex and POBA ___. Per 
discussions with Dr. ___, patient's cardiologist, 
clopidogrel was held given GI bleed and initiation of warfarin. 
Lasix initially held as above, but restarted on discharge at 
20mg daily. Home ASA, statin, and carvedilol were continued. 

# HTN: Nifedipine was decreased to 30mg BID from 60mg BID given 
multiple bleeding episodes and normal blood pressures. Home 
carvedilol continued. Patient's nifedipine was decreased to 30mg 
daily given acute bleed and SBPs in the ___
Lasix was decreased from 40 daily to 20 daily.
 
# Diabetes Mellitus: Stable on home 30 units 70/30 insulin at 
bedtime.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Out patient hypercoaguability work up including screening 
colonoscopy (last in ___ and mammogram
- Patient will need to complete an 8 week course of high dose 
PPI (started 40mg pantoprazole PO twice daily on ___ with 
projected end date ___ for upper GI bleed likely from 
gastritis.
- Patient's hypertension medications (Lisinopril and nifedipine) 
were held due to upper GI bleed.
- Patient's furosemide was decreased to 20mg daily
- Patient's nifedipine was decreased to 30mg daily given acute 
bleed and SBPs in the ___
- Patient was started on Coumadin. Clopidogrel was stopped per 
cardiology. ASA 81mg was continued.

will continue at home. You had an episode of upper GI bleeding 
during your stay for which you are being treated with medication 
and you underwent an EGD. You developed a left arm hematoma as 
well during your stay which will resolve on its own over time.

For your blood clots, you were started on a new drug called 
warfarin. You will need to have your blood checked to adjust the 
dosing. For your upper GI bleed, you were started on 
Pantoprazole 40mg twice daily. You will continue this drug as an 
outpatient for at least 8 weeks. Additionally, you will no 
longer be taking Clopidogrel (Plavix), until you speak with your 
cardiologist.

It was a pleasure taking care you during your hospital stay.

Best wishes,

Your ___ Care Team

distant MI and bare metal stent, stroke, recent unprovoked DVTs 
on Coumadin, and recent upper GI bleeding, who was sent to ___ 
by her physician for anemia (Hgb 6.5).

The patient was admitted to ___ in ___ with unprovoked 
bilateral lower extremity DVTs. She was started on heparin as an 
inpatient, but anticoagulation was complicated by severely 
elevated PTT (>150) and upper GI bleed. Endoscopy was notable 
for significant erythema, superficial ulceration, and gastritis 
without active bleeding. She was placed on BID PPI prophylaxis. 
She was eventually bridged to Coumadin for a planned 6 month 
course. Her INR is managed by her rehab facility, and she is 
followed by Dr. ___ in ___ clinic.

relieved with rest, and symmetrical lower extremity swelling. 
During this period she reports that her appetite remained good, 
and he bowel function was normal. She denies bloody stools or 
dark stool. On ___ she presented to her PCP office from rehab 
reporting increasing shortness of breath and fatigue. She was 
found to have a Hgb of 6.5, with an unconcerning CXR. She was 
sent to the ___ ED.

In the ED, her initial vitals were T: 97.5 P: 60 BP: 156/76 RR: 
16 SPO2: 100% RA. Exam was notable for guiac negative stool.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a past medical 
history of type-2 DM, hypertension, stage IV CKD, CAD s/p 
distant MI and bare metal stent, stroke, recent unprovoked DVTs 
on Coumadin, and recent upper GI bleed, who was sent to ___ by 
her physician for anemia. 

# Anemia: 
Patient presented with Hgb of 6.5, down from her recent baseline 
of ~7.5 since her ___ hospitalization. Upon presentation she 
had a new macrocytic anemia. Hemolysis labs were negative. She 
received two units of packed red cells with an appropriate rise 
in her Hgb to 9.0. Stool was guiac negative, with no reports of 
dark stool or blood in stool. Her hemoglobin remained stable at 
this level, there was no overt bleeding, and her stool was guiac 
negative. After transfusion the patient reported significant 
improvement in her shortness of breath and fatigue. Given her 
history of gastritis and diverticulosis, a GI bleed was believed 
responsible for her anemia. Patient should receive an 
EGD/colonoscopy as an outpatient. 

# Acute exacerbation of heart failure with preserved ejection 
fraction: 
The patient was also found to be slightly volume overloaded, and 
was treated with 2x40mg IV Lasix, with good urine output and 
symptomatic improvement. Her pulmonary edema and peripheral 
edema resolved with diuresis.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Gastic ulceration: 
Continued on home pantoprazole BID

# Hypertension:
Continued on home nifedipine, carvadilol, lisinopril.

# Stage IV Chronic Kidney Disease: 
Creatinine remained at baseline (b/l Cr 2.1-2.6) during 
admission.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
======================
--Patient's Anemia is thought to be due to slow GI bleed given 
history of gastritis and diverticulosis. Please schedule 
EGD/colonoscopy within the next month
--Patient continued on Coumadin for bilateral DVTs; please 
continue to weigh the risks and benefits of anticoagulation 
given history of bleed.

Dear ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you. You were admitted to the 
hospital with fatigue, chest pain, and shortness of breath. You 
were found to have too few red blood cells (anemia). We gave you 
blood, and your symptoms improved. Additionally, you were found 
to have too much fluid in your legs and lungs. We treated you 
with a diuretic, which helped eliminate the fluid. 

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team

FINDINGS: 
There is mild pulmonary edema with superimposed region of more 
confluent consolidation in the left upper lung.  There are 
possible small bilateral pleural effusions.  Moderate 
cardiomegaly is again seen as well as tortuosity of the 
descending thoracic aorta.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
IMPRESSION: 
Mild pulmonary edema with superimposed left upper lung 
consolidation, potentially more confluent edema versus 
superimposed infection.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year-old female with history of hypertension, CAD s/p DES 
with ischemic MR and systolic dysfunction, ___, hx of DVT, who 
admitted for CHF exacerbation.

# Acute on chronic decompensated heart failure: presented in the 
setting of high salt diet with dyspnea on exertion, decreased 
exercise tolerance, ___ edema, crackles on exam, elevated BNP to 
10K, 8lbs above dry weight and pulmonary congestion on CXR. 
Later discovered on pharmacy review that patient had not filled 
torsemide after last outpatient Cardiology appointment where she 
was instructed to start taking it. Troponins cycled and 
negative. On admission, she was placed on a salt and fluid 
restricted diet. She was diuresed with IV Lasix 80mg for 2 days 
and then transitioned to po torsemide 40mg with steady weight 
decline and net negative fluid balance of goal -___ and 
stable renal function. Electrolytes repleted for goal Mg>2 and 
K>4. She was continued on home carvedilol 12.5mg BID, 
atorvastatin 80mg daily and lisinopril 40mg daily for blood 
pressure control and increased home nifedipine CR from 30 to 
60mg BID to achieve goal SBP <140. Discharged with close PCP and 
___ to monitor weights and blood pressure 
control.

# Hypertension: She was continued on home carvedilol 12.5mg BID, 
atorvastatin 80mg daily and lisinopril 40mg daily for blood 
pressure control and increased home nifedipine CR from 30 to 
60mg BID to achieve goal SBP <140. 

# Positive U/A: patient asymptomatic but with 32WBCs, ___, 
+bacteria (although 3 epis). Asymptomatic with no 
fevers/dysuria/malaise. Urine culture negative.

# Left upper lung consolidation: infiltrate per Radiology read 
on admission CXR. No cough, fevers, leukocytosis. Rereviewed 
with on-call radiologist who favored pulmonary edema with no 
need for repeat imaging or PNA treatment unless clinically 
indicated. Monitored without any significant clinical findings.

# DVT: anticoagulated on Coumadin goal 2.0-3.0, no signs of 
thrombus on exam. Daily INR trended and continued on home 
Coumadin 5mg daily. 

# Anemia: no signs of external loss, specifically denying any 
melena. Chronically anemic with baseline ___, presented with Hgb 
8. Likely ___ renal disease and ACD however elevated MCV 
indicates possible reticulocytosis. Altogether low suspicion for 
GIB so Coumadin was continued. Reticulocytes 2.4 which is 
inappropriate arguing against acute loss. Trended daily CBC with 
noted uprising by discharge.

# Chronic kidney disease, stage IV- baseline ___, likely ___ 
HTN and DM. Renally dosed medications and trended Cr with no 
significant change. 
# HLD: continued home atorvastatin
# DM: held home 25U 70/30.  Patient maintained on aspart ISS and 
glargine qHS with good glycemic control.

# Shortness of breath
# Hypoxia
# acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure with 
preserved LVEF (50%)
Dry weight per pt 154 lbs.  Admission weight above baseline, BNP 
elevated.  Regarding trigger, suspect dietary vs uncontrolled 
BP. No EKG changes for ACS, trop negative, repeat TTE showed 
mild regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w prior myocardial 
infarction in the RCA territory, as well as Grade II LV 
diastolic dysfunction and similar to prior ___ TTE. Doubt PNA 
given CXR and lack of cough/fever, doubt PE given low Wells'

Lasix 80 mg, 120mg IV x2 with rapid improvement in subjective 
dyspnea.  Resumed home torsemide 40mg, nifedipine 60mg BID and 
carvedilol 25mg BID.  Was stable on RA prior to discharge.

# Hypertension - Patient missed her antiHTN medications earlier 
day of admission. Continued home carvedilol 25mg BID and 
nifedipine 60mg BID with holding parameters. Appears that a 
trial of ___ or spironolactone would be limited by 
hyperkalemia, so this was deferred.
     
# Urinary frequency/urge incontinence: occurred in setting of 
diuresis, however UCx ordered in ED did grow enterococci, likely 
colonization. If symptoms persists would revaluate/treat.
         
CHRONIC STABLE ISSUES

baseline, no signs of active bleeding.  Likely multifactorial, 
anemia of chronic disease as well as decreased erythropoiten 
production iso CKD.
 
# Non anion gap metabolic acidosis - Patient has intermittently 
had a NAGMA in the past.  No recent diarrhea.  ___ suspect Type 
IV RTA given advanced age and history of T2DM (both of which can 
cause hyporeninemia).

# Stage IV Chronic Kidney Disease (baseline Cr 2.3-2.8) - CKD 
iso HTN and T2DM, Cr is currently at baseline. Low K/Phos/Na 
diet. Continued home calcitriol, avoided nephrotoxins and 
renally dosed all medications.

# Coronary artery disease ___ DES to LCX ___: troponins were 
trended from < 0.01 to 0.05 to 0.04 then stopped. CK-MB was 
flat.  Patient deneied any chest pain. A TTE showed mild 
regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w prior myocardial infarction

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and 
weight gain.  This was likely caused by an exacerbation of your 
heart failure possibly from salty foods over the holiday. 

While you were in the hospital:
- we gave you IV diuretics to help remove extra fluid
- we checked for pneumonia with a chest x-ray, there was no sign 
of a pneumonia
- we checked for signs on new clots in your legs, there was no 
new clot

Now that you are going home:
- continue to take all of your medications as prescribed
- monitor your salt intake, this should be no more than 2 grams 
every day, ask your doctors for help with this if you do not 
know how to keep track of your salt
- continue to weigh yourself every morning, call your doctor if 
weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
- follow-up with your primary care doctor regarding your blood 
pressure and blood sugar control

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

# Fevers: Likely secondary to pneumonia, but possibly a viral 
illness. Most likely not bacterial process but no leukocytosis, 
just PMN predominance. Urine legionella neg. CXR underwhelming 
for pnuemonia but given poor PO intake and overall constellation 
of symptoms without other localizing source and neg CT, so 
patient was treated presumptively for CAP.  O2 sats stable on 
room air during the day, but at night de-satted.  On exam, lungs 
with improved wheezing since yesterday. With ambulation, O2 87, 
on ___, repeat cxr with pulm edema likely due to IV fluid bolus 
day prior. She was given lasix 40mg POx1.  On day of d/c, sats 
mid ___ on RA, down to 88% with prolonged ambulation.  Pt not 
subjectively SOB, likely this is baseline given pt's habitus.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital for a pneumonia.  You were 
started on antibiotics which you will need to continue for one 
more day (as listed below).  You were also a little bit 
dehydrated when you came in, so you received some IV fluids to 
help hydrate you. 

You sodium levels in your blood were a bit low.  This was most 
likely due to the infection in your lungs.  As we treated your 
pneumonia, your sodium levels improved.

The following changes were made to your medications: 
- Please START levofloxacin 750mg daily for 1 more day

If you begin to feel more short of breath or more sick, please 
don't hesitate to call your primary care physician.

History of Present Illness:
This patient is a ___ year old female with Hx of sigmoid 
diverticulitis s/p resection in ___, who complains of RLQ 
abdominal pain. The patient states that her pain began yesterday 
afternoon, worsened overnight and causing her to present to the 
ED around 3AM. She describes it as a ""gnawing"" pain, 
nonradiating, constant and ___ intensity. She states this 
feels similar to her episode of diverticulitis several years 
ago, only is present on the other side of her abdomen. She 
denies any fever, nausea, vomiting, SOB, Chest pain, BRBPR. She 
does endorse subjective feeling of chills.  
.  
Prior to the current episode, the patient reports having a 
""sinus infection"" about 3 weeks ago that resolved over one week 
ago. About 2 weeks ago she also began taking a low dose OCP in 
order to treate perimenopausal cramping. On the second week she 
started to have spotting, with intermittent bleeding and LH this 
past week. She had an episode of diarrhea one week ago ___ 
morning), that was nonbloody and resolved on its own. Starting 
on ___ she has had a feeling of ""lightheadedness"" 
associated with diaphoresis and nausea.  
.  
In the ED, initial VS were: 8 97.2 88 117/64 18 100%. Patient 
was given morphine 4 mg IV, dilaudid 0.5 mg IV x 6, zofran 4 mg 
IV, and 3 L NS. She underwent bimanual exam that was reportedly 
without signs of mass, CMT, or adnexal tenderness. Labs were 
notable for a leukocytosis of 11, but were otherwise 
unremarkable. CT abdomen showed normal appendix but thick-walled 
cecum with appearance of possible mass. Pelvic ultrasound did 
not show any source of her pain. As she did not have adequate 
relief with pain medications, she was admitted to the medical 
service for pain control.

Blood Culture ___: No growth (not final at time of 
discharge)

Imaging:
Pelvic U/S ___: FINDINGS: Transabdominally the uterus measures 
8.6 x 4.6 x 5.4 cm, and is slightly heterogeneous in appearance 
with no distinct fibroids seen. Transvaginal exam was performed 
for better evaluation of the uterus and adnexa. The endometrial 
stripe measures 5 mm. The left ovary measures 3.5 x 1.6 x 1.8 
cm. The right ovary measures 2.9 x 1.4 x 1.7 cm. There is a 
small echogenic focus within the right ovary measuring 5 x 4 x 4 
mm, likely a small hemorrhagic cyst. Both ovaries demonstrate 
normal arterial and venous waveforms.   
IMPRESSION:  
1. No evidence of ovarian torsion.  
2. Small right ovarian hemorrhagic cyst. 
.
CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast ___:  Scattered calcified 
granulomas in 
the lung bases are stable. There is no new focal pulmonary 
nodule, 
consolidation, or effusion. The cardiac apex is within normal 
limits.  
Complete evaluation of the intra-abdominal viscera is limited by 
the 
non-contrast technique. However, the liver appears homogeneous 
without focal lesion. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal 
dilatation is identified.  The gallbladder, spleen, and pancreas 
appear within normal limits. The adrenal glands are symmetric 
without focal nodule. The kidneys appear homogeneous without 
focal lesion or hydronephrosis. The abdominal aorta is 
non-aneurysmal throughout its visualized course. The second and 
third portions of the duodenum are equivocally thickened which 
may be due to underdistension. No small bowel obstruction is 
identified. The appendix is well visualized and is normal in 
appearance. There is no free fluid or free air. 
  
CT PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST ___: Initial images 
demonstrated a solid mass like abnormality in the cecal tip 
measuring approximately 3 cm (2:51).  As this was potentially 
concerning for a cecal mass, rescanning of a limited portion of 
pelvis was performed after passage of oral contrast, confirming 
the finding and demonstrating a 3 cm mass with thickening of the 
adjacent cecal wall (601:15). The adjacent appendix is normal 
and there is no pericecal inflammatory change.  
The remainder of the colon is normal without evidence of 
obstruction or 
inflammation. The surgical anastomosis within the lower midline 
pelvis 
appears unremarkable. There is no pelvic free fluid. The uterus 
and adnexa 
appear within normal limits. The bladder is markedly distended 
but is 
otherwise unremarkable. No pathologically enlarged pelvic or 
inguinal lymph nodes are identified. 
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No bone destructive lesion or acute fracture 
is 
identified.  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Findings consistent with a 3 cm cecal mass and thickening of 
the cecal tip concerning for neoplasm. Atypical infectious 
process causing this appearance is felt less likely due to lack 
of inflammatory stranding. Recommend colonoscopy for further 
evaluation.  
2. Normal appendix, no signs of inflammation. 
3. No small or large bowel obstruction. 
4. Equivocal thickening of duodenum likely related to 
underdistention.  

Colonoscopy ___:
Findings:  
 Lumen: Evidence of a previous end to end ___ 
anastomosis was seen at the sigmoid colon.  
 Protruding Lesions A ulcerated 3 cm mass of malignant 
appearance was found in the cecum. The scope traversed the 
lesion. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at 
the cecum.  
 Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula with small openings were 
seen in the descending colon.  
Impression: Mass in the cecum (biopsy)
Diverticulosis of the descending colon
Previous end to end ___ anastomosis of the sigmoid 
colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and terminal ileum 
.
PATHOLOGY:
DIAGNOSIS: 
""Cecal mass"", mucosal biopsies: 
Colonic mucosa with focal ischemic change and abundant 
associated ulceration, exudate, and granulation tissue 
formation; no carcinoma or dysplasia in these samples.  Five 
levels are examined.

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ year-old female with history significant for 
diverticulitis s/p sigmoid resection in ___, who presented with 
abdominal pain and was found to have cecal mass.  
.  
# Abdominal pain: Was most likely related to hemorrhagic ovarian 
cyst.  Initially, patient had significant pain that was not 
relieved with dilaudid.  However, over the course of several 
days her pain resolved on its own and she no longer required any 
pain medications.  Bloodwork and imaging were not suggestive of 
any intra-abdominal infection.  The patient was advised to 
follow-up with her gynecologist regarding her ovarian cyst, and 
the need for continued therapy with low dose oral contraceptive. 
  
.  
# Cecal Mass: During the workup of this patient's abdominal 
pain, a CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a 3 cm cecal mass 
concerning for malignancy.  During this hospitalization she 
underwent colonoscopy with biopsy of the mass.  She was 
instructed to follow-up with her outpatient gastroenterologist 
regarding the results of this biopsy in one week.  The biopsy 
was negative for malignancy.   
.  
# Anxiety - Patient was continued on home regimen of zoloft and 
ativan.  
.  
# Gerd - Patient continued on omeprazole, zantac BID per 
outpatient regimen.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain, which we 
think was related to a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst.  You were 
treated with analgesics, and your pain resolved.  You also had a 
CAT scan showing a mass in the cecum.  You underwent a 
colonoscopy to biopsy this mass, and you should follow-up with 
your gastroenterologist. 

You should also see your gynecologist regarding the need to 
restart your oral contraceptive.

We did not make any changes to your home medications.

IMAGING
==========================
___ CXR
IMPRESSION: Hilar congestion without frank edema.  No convincing 
signs of pneumonia.

___ CTA chest showed:
1. Extensive pulmonary embolism with thrombus seen extending 
from the right main pulmonary artery into the segmental and 
subsegmental right upper, middle, and lower lobe pulmonary 
arteries. No right heart strain identified. 2. Additionally, 
there are smaller pulmonary emboli seen in the segmental and 
subsegmental branches of the left upper and lower lobes. 3. 
Several pulmonary nodules are noted, as noted previously, with 
the largest appearing spiculated and measuring up to 1 cm in the 
right middle lobe, suspicious for malignancy on the previous 
PET-CT. 4. Re- demonstration of 2 left breast nodules for which 
correlation with mammography and ultrasound is suggested.

___ ___:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval progression of deep vein thrombosis in the left 
lower extremity, with occlusive thrombus involving the entire 
femoral vein, previously only involving the mid and distal 
femoral vein.  There is additional nonocclusive thrombus in the 
deep femoral vein.  The left common femoral and popliteal veins 
are patent.
2. The bilateral calf veins were not visualized due to an 
overlying dressing. Otherwise no evidence of deep venous 
thrombosis in the right lower extremity.

___ TTE:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity 
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). 
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild) left 
ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. 
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. 

___ CXR
IMPRESSION: 
Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___. 
Heart size top-normal.  Lungs grossly clear.  No pleural 
abnormality or evidence of central lymph node enlargement.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman s/p robotic radical cystectomy 
___omplicated by bacteremia and 
abscess, LLE DVT, currently on daily lovenox who presents with 
dyspnea on exertion and dyspnea on exertion and found to have 
large PE and progression of DVT.

# PE/DVT: Likely due to undertreatment of known LLE DVT with 
prophylactic dosing of lovenox. Given underdosing of lovenox, 
this was not thought to be treatment failure and IVC filter was 
deferred. She had no signs of right heart strain on imaging, 
EKG, exam. TTE showed no evidence of right heart strain. She was 
treated with a heparin gtt, then transitioned to treatment dose 
lovenox given malignancy associated thrombosis as noted in CLOT 
trial. She is quite symptomatic and requires oxygen 
supplementation, though improved during hospitalization. Please 
wean oxygen as tolerated.

# Pulmonary nodules: Known spiculated masses that were noted on 
CT in ___, concerning for primary lung malignancy vs mets. 
Current CT showed stable nodules still concerning for 
malignancy. She was evaluated by the thoracic team who 
recommended CT biopsy vs. surveillance. Given her current 
PE/DVT, the family and the patient decided for surveillance at 
this time. They will follow up with her primary care provider. 

# Enterococcal UTI
She was noted to have rising WBC in the setting of UCX from 
urostomy growing Enterococcus. Given her rising leukocytosis, we 
proceeded with treatment. She was started on IV Ampicillin and 
transitioned to macrobid, based on sensitivies. Leukocytosis 
improved on antibiotics. She should complete a 7 day course (day 
1: ___, day 7: ___. 

# Normocytic Anemia: No signs of bleeding, or hemolysis. Hb 
dropped to nadir of 7.3, stable at discharge at 7.5. Iron 
studies consistent with likely combination iron deficiency 
anemia and anemia of chronic disease with low iron but elevated 
ferritin and low TIBC. Would recommend checking again as 
outpatient and work-up as needed.

# ___ swelling: Likley multifactorial including venous 
insufficiency, as well as known LLE DVT. She responded quite 
well with compression stockings.

# Hx of bladder cancer: s/p ___ TURBT, high-grade TCC, T1 
(no muscle identified). Then in ___, pelvic MRI showed 
bladder mass invasion, perivesical soft tissue, anterior vaginal 
wall on right (C/W T4 lesion). In ___, underwent robotic 
TAH-BSO, lap radical cystectomy and anterior vaginectomy with 
pathology showing pT2b, node and margins negative. No plan for 
any further therapy at this time per Dr ___.

The patient is safe to discharge today, and >30min were spent on 
discharge day management services.

Transitional issues:
- She will need follow up chest CT for pulmonary nodules in 3 
months (___)
- To complete 7 day course for UTI with macrobid (day 7: ___
- Continue oxygen therapy and wean as tolerated to maintain O2 
sat > 92% 
- Please check CBC on ___ to ensure stability of h/h 
and demonstrate resolution of leukocytosis

PERTINENT IMAGING:
==================
CT ABD&PEL W/ CONTRAST 
___
1. Interval decrease in size of the right hemipelvis fluid 
collection (7.0 x 6.5 x 11.3 cm, previously 10.0 x 12.7 x 14.8 
cm) with the anterior approach pigtail catheter unchanged in 
position.  The pigtail is again located partly within the 
collection and partly outside its wall. 
2. Interval increase in size of the left pelvic fluid 
collection, now 
measuring 14.7 x 16.2 x 23.3 cm (previously 13.6 x 13.9 x 23.0 
cm). Increased peripheral enhancement may suggest superimposed 
infection. 
3. No new fluid collection identified. 
  
CTA ABD & PELVIS
___
1. Decrease in size of right lower quadrant fluid collection 
that has 
percutaneous drain within it, with areas of high attenuation on 
noncontrast exam consistent with blood products, and associated 
hyperemia which is likely inflammatory, but without evidence of 
contrast extravasation. 
2. There is large stable fluid collection in the low left 
abdomen, pelvis with mild linear peripheral enhancement, 
infection cannot be excluded. 
3. There is severe left, and moderate to severe right 
hydroureteronephrosis, with delayed left nephrogram, stable from 
today.  Mass effect about anastomosis between distal ureters and 
neobladder has resolved all since ___, and while 
hydronephrosis may be from residual edema, if this does not 
resolve, alternative etiologies including stenosis, tumor 
infiltration should be excluded. 
4. Tiny hepatic lesion segment ___, attention to this area on 
subsequent 
followups recommended. 

CT INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURE
___ 
1.  Complete collapse the patient has recently drained left 
lower quadrant 
collection.  The catheter from this collection was removed. 
2.  Near complete collapse of the patient is originally drained 
collection in the mid pelvis, with pigtail catheter in place. 
3.  Left lower quadrant and deep pelvic collections as above.  
These findings were discussed with the team.  Given the 
patient's improving clinical status, the decision was made to 
pursue no further collection drainage at this time. 
4.  Severe bilateral hydronephrosis, as on prior examinations. 
RECOMMENDATION:  Given persistence of severe hydronephrosis, 
percutaneous 
nephrostomy tubes should be considered. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY:
==============
___ year old women with a history of bladder cancer s/p 
cystectomy, hysterectomy, and BSO now with ileal conduit, whose 
post operative course has been complicated by DVT/PE, ileus, and 
pelvic fluid collections w/ one LLQ drain presented with 
subjective fevers, lethargy, and bloody drain output. She was 
found to have worsening anemia and was given 2 units of pRBC 
with appropriate increase in hemoglobin noted. She was also 
found on CT imaging to have an interval increase in size of a 
left abdominal fluid collection. Decision was made to place a 
drain per ID. Fluid was sent and revealed: negative cultures, 
negative malignant cells, no evidence of lymphatic or urinary 
fluid. This new drain was subsequently removed per ___ as fluid 
collection was completely drained. The prior drain was still 
draining serosanguinous fluid and was kept in but repositioned. 
ID was consulted for the fevers, leukocytosis and fluid 
collections and was deemed to need antibiotics and tranisitioned 
from broad spectrum to IV ertapenem at discharge. Will require 
multiple follow ups and imaging as specified in the transitional 
issues. 
 
ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Pelvic fluid collections: patient arrived with one anterior 
drain putting out serosanguinous fluid. CT abdomen/pelvis 
revealed enlarging left fluid collection, and decision was made 
to place a drain per ___. The fluid was negative for malignant 
cells. The fluid had Cr 1 and triglycerides <9 suggesting that 
fluid collection is neither urine nor lymphatic fluid. Fluid 
culture was negative for bacteria. On interval imaging, the new 
enlarging fluid collection had completely collapsed and the 
drain was removed. As for the other fluid collection that 
already had a drain putting out serosanguinous fluid, it 
continued to drain serosanguinous fluid but at a lower rate than 
prior to admission. The drain was left in place as the fluid 
collection on imaging had not completely collapsed. BID - N 
cultures for the aforementioned fluid collection came back 
positive for MSSA but per ID, does not reflect rue 
intra-abdominal infection. Given that patient had a fever at OSH 
and a leukocytosis, she was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics 
with vanc, ceftaz and flagyl. This was tapered per ID team to IV 
zosyn. On discharge, ID recommended ertapenem for approximately 
4 weeks with final length of treatment to be determined by fluid 
collection changes on repeat imaging on outpatient basis. Mrs. 
___ remained afebrile, and leukocytosis resolved. 

#Pulmonary embolism: Likely developed in the setting of being 
diagnosed with a post-op DVT. She was placed on lovenox.  She 
was transitioned to heparin ggt as she needed ___ procedures and 
was transitioned back to lovenox but at a lower dose per weight 
dosing to 70mg q12H upon discharge. 

#Acute renal injury: SCr has been steadily rising from a 
baseline of around 0.04-0.06 in ___ to 1.1, likely 
___ obstructed uropathy ___ large pelbic fluid collections. ___ 
resolved over the course of her hospital stay with final Cr 0.8. 


#Hydronephrosis: bilateral and worsening on interval imaging 
from prior studies. Given patient's age, adequate urinary 
output, adequate creatinine clearance, and no significant 
electrolyte abnormalities, patient likely would not 
significantly benefit from intervention at this time. Per 
urology consult, deemed stable for discharge and recommended 
outpatient urology followup. 

#Anemia: likely a combination of anemia of chronic inflammation 
and acute blood loss ___ to anterior abdominal drain showing 
serosanguinous fluid. Labs not consistent with hemolysis. 
Received 2 units of pRBC with appropriate response. Patient was 
discharged with Hgb of 8.3 per hem/onc recommendation for 
threshold Hgb>8 as patient feels and functionally performs 
better with higher blood counts. 

#Hypokalemia: was hypokalemic and was repleted with oral KCl 
PRN. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma, involving the deep 
muscularis propria
S/p cystectomy, hysterectomy, and BSO now with ileal conduit, 
whose post operative course has been complicated by DVT/PE, 
ileus, and pelvic fluid collections.  Patient stating that there 
is no plan for chemo and radiation, her PET scan does show 
concerning foci of metastatic disease in the lung and 
peritoneum. Per patient's son, Mrs. ___ has seen a doctor 
to work up the lung mass. Will need ongoing discussion with 
outpatient hem/onc regarding how to best manage concerning 
lesions. 

#Breast mass ___ mammogram showing BI-RADS 5, Solid mass 
in the 3 o'clock left breast with features of a highly 
suspicious for malignancy. Per patient's son, she has seen a 
doctor for evaluating the new breast mass. Would recommend 
ongoing discussion with aforementioned doctor and outpatient 
hem/onc about plan to manage.

# HLD: continued atorvastatin without changes. Consider 
evaluation regarding stopping atorvastatin on outpatient basis 
 
# Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine without changes.   
  
#HCP:  Dr. ___ (son, ___ physician) ___
#Code status: full code (confirmed with patient on ___

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ year old woman with history of provoked 
DVT/PE (on lovenox), bladder cancer s/p Robotic TAH-BSO, lap 
radical cystectomy with ileal loop diversion and anterior 
vaginectomy in ___ c/b abdominal fluid requiring 
placement of drainage catheters, and recent hydronephrosis 
requiring placement of bilateral PCN tubes on ___, presenting 
from rehab with hematuria and weakness.

On arrival, pt had evidence of frank hematuria in her urostomy 
bag and PCN tubes. Her hemoglobin was initially 8.1, which 
subsequently dropped to 7.0 Her lovenox was held, and she was 
transfused with 1 U PRBC with an appropriate hemoglobin bump to 
8.2. Hematuria was likely caused by recent instrumentation in 
the setting of anticoagulation. Her hematuria improved, as did 
her dizziness/weakness. ___ was consulted and recommending 
capping her PCN tubes. After discussion with the patient's 
hematologist, it was decided to stop her lovenox treatment given 
that her DVT/PE were provoked in the setting of her recovery 
from surgery, and that she had received almost 6 months of 
treatment.

Secondary Issues:

# Asymptomatic bacteruria: Patient with asymptomatic bacteruria 
in setting of recent procedural manipulation. She was afebrile 
and without leukocytosis, so treatment with antibiotics was 
deferred.

# Hyperlipidemia: continued atorvastatin 10 mg daily

# Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine 175 mcg daily

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted with sepsis from a urinary tract 
infection after her stent exchange. She was placed empirically 
on vancomycin and cefepime (narrowed to vanc/ceftriaxone on 
HD#1), because of her history of resistant organisms. She 
rapidly improved. Her urine grew E. faecium, sensitive to 
ampicillin. Therefore, a PICC line was placed, and she will 
complete two weeks total of ampicillin for a complicated urinary 
tract infection (additional day days). She will follow up with 
Dr. ___ as an outpatient. She will stop her prophylactic TMP 
while on ampicillin, but then resume after finishing her course.
- ampicillin 500 mg TID x 9 additional days
- restart TMP 100 mg daily for ppx after antibiotic course

2. Widened superior mediastinum with leftward deviation of the 
trachea, similar when compared to the prior study. Findings may 
reflect the presence of a thyroid goiter, and clinical 
correlation is recommended, and if indicated, this could be 
confirmed with a CT of the chest.  
  
L-spine film ___: Five non-rib-bearing lumbar-type vertebral 
 
bodies are present. There are multilevel degenerative changes, 
with loss of intervertebral disc height at multiple levels, 
endplate sclerotic changes, and anterior osteophyte formation. 
There is no fracture or vertebral compression deformity 
identified. There is likely mild grade 1 L5 on S1 
anterolisthesis, which is likely degenerative in etiology. Facet 
hypertrophic changes are noted within the lower lumbar spine 
primarily affecting L3 through L5 levels. Vascular 
calcifications are visualized. The sacroiliac joints are not 
diastatic.  
IMPRESSION: No fracture identified.  

CT head ___:
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema or acute 
vascular 
territorial infarction. Note is made of areas of 
encephalomalacia involving the parietal lobe on the left, which 
appear unchanged as does an area of hypodensity on the right 
adjacent to the caudat.. Similarly unchanged are two left 
frontal meningiomas, the larger of which is partially calcified, 
and better depicted on the prior MRI (2:24, 601:19). Ventricles 
and sulci are enlarged, reflecting parenchymal volume loss. Note 
is made of atherosclerotic calcification at the carotid siphons 
bilaterally as well as of both V4 segments. There is no 
fracture. The mastoid air cells are clear. 
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality, and unchanged 
findings of 
previous infarcts and meningiomas. 

LENIs ___:
Waveforms in the common femoral veins are symmetric bilaterally 
with appropriate responses to Valsalva maneuvers. In both lower 
extremities, the common femoral, proximal greater saphenous, 
superficial femoral and popliteal veins are normal with 
appropriate compressibility, wall-to-wall flow on color Doppler 
analysis and response to waveform augmentation. Wall-to-wall 
flow is also visualized in the posterior tibial and peroneal 
veins of both calves.
IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity. 

  

MICROBIOLOGY: 
___: Blood culture - no growth to date

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with DM, afib, and CHF presenting with pulm edema and 
worsening ___ edema.
 
# CHF: Likely an acute on chronic worsening of diastolic 
congestive heart failure (most recent LVEF >55%) and recent 
decrease in mobility from fall. Ruled out for MI. Likely his 
worsening edema is due to medication non-compliance versus 
worsening of his aortic stenosis. His most recent echo is from 
___, and it was recommended this be repeated as an outpatient. 
He was never hypoxic, though lung exam suggested increased pulm 
edema. His legs were elevated and compression stockings were 
used. His torsemide was dosed at 10mg daily, though it's unclear 
if this was an increase from 5mg or the same dose, and the 
patient and wife were unable to clarify. There was slight 
improvement in swelling on discharge.
 
# RECENT FALLS: Patient reports falling twice recently at home 
and on a trip. He was evaluated by physical therapy, who felt he 
is unsteady on his feet but safe for discharge home with ___ and 
a walker/commode. The wife was instructed to maintain 24 hour 
care for him in the home to help prevent further falls. 

# ___: Cr up to 1.6 on admission. Improved to 1.3 the next day, 
likely closer to baseline. 
   
# DM: Glipizide and actos held while in hospital. Covered with 
an insulin sliding scale and oral medications restarted on

protocol 
representing a fair exercise tolerance for her age; ~ ___ METS. 
The 
exercise test was stopped at the patient's request secondary to 
fatigue. 
During exercise, the patient reported a non-progressive, 
isolated upper 
left-sided chest discomfort; ___. The area of discomfort was 
reportedly 
tender to palpation. This discomfort resolved with rest and was 
absent 
2.5 minutes post-exercise. In the presence of the LBBB, the ST 
segments 
are uninterpretable for ischemia. The rhythm was sinus with 
frequent 
isolated APDs and occasional atrial couplets and atrial 
triplets. 
Resting mild systolic hypertension with normal blood pressure 
response 
to exercise. The heart rate response to exercise was mildly 
blunted. 
  
IMPRESSION: Fair exercise tolerance. No anginal symptoms with 
uninterpretable ECG to achieved workload. Resting mild systolic 
hypertension with appropriate blood pressure response to 
exercise. 
Suboptimal study - target heart rate not achieved. 
 
SIGNED:  ___ 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ ___ with several month history of left sided arm and chest 
wall pain in the setting of LBBB presenting for ___.  
.  
.  
# Chest Pain:The patient's symptoms were not typically anginal 
in nature to suggest ACS. However she does have several cardiac 
risk factors and a LBBB, so  physicians could  not r/oMI with 
EKG alone. Trop. results were negative x3. Stress Echo revealed 
new regional dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior and 
inferolateral walls consistent with single vessel disease in the 
PDA distribution. A cardiology consult was obtained and they 
felt she could be managed medically. Patient was already on an 
aspirin, and a statin. Given history to suggest asthma B-blocker 
was contraindicated. She was discharged on 120 mg extended 
release diltiazem with instructions to follow up in cardiology 
and with her PCP. 
.
# Supraventricular tachycardia: The patient had multiple runs of 
SVT that was likley MAT in the setting of severe obstructive 
lung disease and chronic theophylline use. Cardiology 
reccomended that we discontinue her theophylline. We spoke with 
her pulmonologist who agreed this would be the best course of 
action for her. She was discharged with instructions to 
discontinue use of theophylline and follow up with her 
pulmonologist and cardiology.

echo done on ___, thought to be single vessel disease who 
presents with intermittent chest pain since her recent discharge 
on ___. During her recent hospitalization she was ruled out 
for an MI with three negative sets of cardiac enzymes, she had a 
stress echo which showed inducible ischemia at the achieved 
workload, thought to be single vessel disease per the echo 
report. At that time the plan was for medical management, given 
her severe underlying pulmonary disease she was not started on a 
beta blocker, but was started on diltiazem 120mg daily. Also 
during that admission she was found to have intermittent 
episodes of MAT. Today she was on the phone with her ___ year 
old aunt, who is very hard or hearing, she says that she became 
frustrated when her aunt was ___ to hear her on the phone and 
she started to have some chest pain. The pain began in the 
___ her chest, as a dull pain then moved up to her left 
shoulder and under her left breast, at its worst was a ___. 
She took three SL nitro's at home, with some minor improvement 
in her CP but when it did not resolve she called Dr. ___ 
referred her to the ER. She denied any associated SOB, 
nausea/vomiting. She denies any orthopnea, PND, ___ edema or 
palpitations.  
.  
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.7, 73, 183/92, 20, 98% on RA. 
Her EKG had a LBBB that was unchanged from prior, CXR with no 
acute process. Patient given aspirin 243mg since she had already 
taken 81mg of aspirin at home. She was not given anything for 
her episodes of chest pain as they resolved without further 
intervention. Vitals on transfer were 71, 121/56, 22, 100% on 
RA.  
.  
On arrival to the floor, patient's initial VS were: 98.9, 
140/86, 68, 18, 97% on RA. She says that she currently may have 
a little bit of cental CP, but otherwise feels well and has no 
complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with 
a recent diagnosis of CAD, HTN and asthma who presents with 
intermittent episodes of chest pain since her recent discharge.  

......................................
Active Issues:
.  
# CORONARIES: patient with intermittent episodes of left chest 
burning, that are not typical of angina since they resolve 
without intervention, are not relieved by nitro and have no 
association with exercise. However, given the findings on her 
recent stress echo of inducible ischemia it is concerning that 
her current symptoms could be related to her underlying CAD. Her 
troponins were negative during this hospital stay.  On this 
admission, she was started on Imdur 30 in addition to the 
medications started on last discharge as it was decided that she 
may need better medical management prior to resorting to PCI 
(which may be a possibility in the future). After administration 
of IMDUR, we walked the patient down the hall, as well as up 
several flights of stairs. She denied feeling short of breath, 
nor did she endorse any other cardiac symtpoms, such as chest 
pain. In fact, she stated that she felt well walking. 
.  
# RHYTHM: LBBB on EKG from yesterday, regular. patient with a 
new diagnosis of MAT on last admission. We continued her on 
Diltiazem. She had several episodes of MAT on tele, but was 
asymptomatic. Given frequent PAT, ___ of Hearts monitor was 
arranged for her on discharge to exclude the possibility that 
symptoms are due to a tachyarrhythmia. 
.............................................
Inactive Issues:
# Hypertension: continued home HCTZ and diltiazem..  
# Asthma:continued home medications.    
# GERD: continued home omeprazole

CODE: full code  
.....................................  
Transitional Issues:
1) Patient was started on Imdur 30mg daily in additon to her 
other medications. She is being medically managed for her 
coronary artery disease but may be a candidate for PCI in the 
future if the symtpoms of chest pain return.

Brief Hospital Course:
To Do:
1) follow-up theophylline level
___ yo F smoker with PMH of asthma/COPD managed with theophylline 
until ___ when theophylline was discontinued because of 
tachycardia, CAD, HTN, and hyperlipidemia who presented from 
home with asymptomatic tachyarrythmia.
.  
ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# Tachycarrhymia in context of recent inducible ischemia seen on 
ECHO stress test (___):  At the time of admission, her 
symptoms had resolved, no abnormalities were seen on imaging or 
labs, and her VS and PEx were remarkable only for non-acute lung 
findings.  MI was ruled out by trop negative x3, no EKG changes. 
 Cardiology was consulted to evaluate need for catheterization 
vs other intervention, but did not feel that any urgent 
inpatient work-up was necessary, especially in the context of 
asymptomatic tachycardia.  She had already had Holter and ECHO 
prior to this admission.  Cardiology recommended restarting 
theophylline if, in fact, she received such benefit from 
pulmonary point of view.  She was restarted on theophylline 
200mg TID, which was her dose prior to discontinuation.  She 
received tobacco cessation education, was continued on home 
diltiazem and aspirin (dose was temporarily increased to 325mg 
prior to ruling out MI).  Admission theopylline level was 
pending at the time of discharge.
.  
# Asthma and COPD: patient was given Albuterol and ipratropium 
nebs, and she was continued on her home doses of fluticasone, 
montelukast, fluticasone-salmetrol.  She was given O2 PRN.  
After cardiology consult, she was restarted on her theophylline 
at 200mg TID, with pulm and cardiology follow-up.
.  
# Tobacco abuse: she declined nicotine patch, and education was 
given regarding the health hazards of smoking.
.  
# HL: patient was continued oh her simvastatin, but because her 
LDL was not at goal (<70), her dose was increased to 40mg daily.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# HTN: continued isosorbide and hydrochlorothiazide at home 
doses.

INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old woman with a history of PAD and 
 
LBBB was referred to the lab from the ER following negative 
serial  
cardiac markers for evaluation of chest discomfort. The patient 
was  
referred for a dipyridamole stress test but due to her 
theophylline  
therapy we were not able to proceed. Due to her frequent atrial 
ectopy we chose not to give her dobutamine but had her walk on 
the treadmill instead. She exercised for 3 minutes of a modified 
___ protocol and stopped due to leg claudication. The 
estimated peak MET capacity was 2.5 which represents a poor 
functional capacity for her age. No arm, neck, back or chest 
discomfort was reported by the patient throughout the study. The 
ST segments are uninterpretable for ischemia in the setting of 
the baseline LBBB. The rhythm was sinus with frequent isolated 
apbs, occasional atrial couplets and a 6 beat run of PSVT. Rare 
isolated vpbs were also noted. Resting mild systolic 
hypertension with a pprorpriate increase in BP with exercise and 
recovery.  
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or interpretable ST 
segments at a high cardiac demand and poor functional capacity. 
Nuclear report sent separately.  
3. ___ CATH:  
LMCA: short, no CAD. LAD: mild  
focal origin disease (20%) and mild proximal disease (30%). LCX: 
 
minimal luminal irregularities. RCA: 30%.  
4. ECG ___: sinus rhythm with multiple PACs, left axis 
deviation, old LBBB 
5. ECG ___: Likely atrial tachycardia. Left bundle-branch 
block. Compared to the previous tracing atrial tachycardia has 
replaced sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions. Left 
bundle-branch block was previously noted. 
6. ECHO ___: Conclusions  
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There 
is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular 
ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic 
mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The left 
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is 
no pericardial effusion. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
frequent atrial ectopy is seen; biventricular function appears 
similar.   

Micro: ___: Bcx pending
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course
===========================================================
___ PMH of CAD, PVD, and COPD presenting with recurrent 
non-exertional substernal chest pain. The patient has a history 
of mild CAD but labs were significant for negative troponins and 
EKG was without ischemic changes. During her admission, she also 
developed multiple episodes of atrial tachycardia (AFib vs. 
Aflutter) and was started on Amiodarone for rate/rhythm control 
and Rivaroxaban for anticoagulation, and kept on home dose of 
Diltiazem also for rate control. She did not have any episodes 
of chest pain during hospitalization, so was discharged once 
atrial fibrillation/flutter was controlled. She will need to 
follow up with her primary care doctor regarding vague chest 
pain which led to admission.

Acute Issues:
========================================================
#Atrial Tachycardia: During admission pt had runs of wide 
complex tachyarrythmia, thought likely supraventricular in 
origin: rapid Atrial Fibrillation/ Flutter vs. atrial 
tachycardia, with abberancy (complexes with similar morphology 
to native LBBB). She was treated with Diltiazem and Amiodarone 
and had fewer episodes of tachycardia. EP team evaluated patient 
and recommended anticoagulation and outpatient follow up to 
consider EP study and possible ablation of Atrial Flutter. 
Patient was discharged with ___ of Hearts monitor, Amiodarone 
200mg twice daily x 1 week followed by 200 mg daily thereafter. 
Diltiazem continued at home dose. Rivaroxaban added for 
anticoagulation. As per outpatient cardiologist (Dr. ___, 
plavix was discontinued in light of addition of Rivaroxaban and 
interest in avoiding triple therapy in this patient. Pt was 
given follow up appointments with Drs. ___. She was 
scheduled to see Dr. ___ EP evaluation in 2 months.

#Chest pain: Pt presented with substernal chest pain that 
occurred at rest and was ruled out for MI with no troponin 
elevation or significant new ECG changes. Likely her chest pain 
was related to periods of tachycardia, although while in the 
hospital the runs of atrial tachycardia did not reproduce chest 
pain. She did not have any episodes of chest pain during 
hospitalization, so was discharged once atrial 
fibrillation/flutter was controlled. She will need to follow up 
with her primary care doctor regarding vague chest pain which 
led to admission.

#Dry eyes: pt had erythema and pain of R eye, found to have dry 
eyes per optholmology. Sent out with Artificial tears and 
erythromycin eye drops. Patient had follow up appointment 
already scheduled with optholmology and was instructed to attend 
appointment.

Chronic Issues:
=============================================================
# COPD  Pt appeared to be at baseline respiratory status. She 
was sent home with her home albuterol neb, albuterol inhaler, 
Fluticasone nasal spray, fluticasone-salmeterol diskus, 
tiotropium bromide nebs, and theophylline

# PAD: 
As above, we stopped Clopidogrel as patient is now on 
Rivaroxaban and wanted to avoid triple therapy as per her 
cardiologist Dr. ___.

Transitional Issues:
==============================================================
1. Patient was discharged on Amiodarone 200 mg po twice daily 
for one week until ___ and then 200mg po daily thereafter 
until her EP appointment with Dr. ___ in approximately 2 months.
2. Pt was discharged on Rivaroxaban 20 mg qpm with dinner
3. Pt discharged with outpatient ___ of Hearts monitor with 
results to be interpreted by Cardiologist.
4. She presented with chest pain but did not have elevated 
biomarkers or EKG changes concerning for myocardial damage. 
Moreover, pt remained asymptomatic during periods of 
supraventricular tachycardia while she was hospitalized. Patient 
may benefit from outpatient stress test if such symptoms return.
5. On day of discharge, pt had significant R eye pain and 
redness, was evaluated by Optholmology, who felt that it was 
just dry eyes, treated with erythromycin drops and artifiical 
tears. Patient already has appt w/ Opthamology in 5 days which 
she will need to attend.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ due to concerning chest pain symptoms 
which we think are due to infrequent bursts of a rapid heart 
rate. Since the rapid rate makes you at increased risk for 
stroke, you were started on a blood thinning medication called 
Rivaroxaban which you will need to take every day. Our 
specialized cardiologists who deal specifically with the 
electrical rhythm of the heart evaluated you and felt that you 
would benefit from a medication called amiodarone which was also 
started. You will need to follow up with them in their clinic 
regarding this abnormal rhythm. In the meantime, you were 
outfitted with a Holter monitor to record your heart rate at 
home. It is very important that you follow up with Dr. ___ 
your cardiologist.

We wish you all the best,

Sincerely,
Your care team at ___

ACTIVE PROBLEMS
#GI Bleed: Presented to PCP with melena and wiping BRBPR. CBC 
was taken and Hgb found to drop from 11.3->8.8. Two large bore 
IVs were placed, started on IV PPI, and she was type and 
screened. Vitals remained stable, so patient was continued on 
home rivaroxaban. She was evaluated by GI who recommended upper 
GI endoscopy, which showed no evidence of bleeding. She remained 
hemodynamically stable throughout the admission. Hgb 9.1 on day 
of discharge. She was discharged home on both her Xarelto and 
ASA.

#SOB: Long standing history of smoking and COPD. Progressive 
exertional dyspnea despite use of Spiriva, advair, fluticasone 
nasal spray, theophylline, and albuterol nebulizers. Has 
increased rescue inhaler use.  Etiology unclear, does not appear 
to be infectious given chronicity. Most likely is progression of 
underlying COPD. PFT's were obtained while in-house. Smoking 
cessation was also discussed. Will need continued outpatient f/u 
re: her COPD.

CHRONIC PROBLEMS
#Afib: Continued home amiodarone and diltiazem. Continued 
rivaroxaban for anticoagulation, as discussed above.

#HTN: Stable, continued on home diltiazem, Imdur, HCTZ

#Anxiety/insomnia: stable, continued home lorazepam QHS PRN for 
insomnia/anxiety.

#Dry eyes: History of glaucoma. Continued home latanoprost 
ophthalmic drops.

#PAD: Stable, continued on home atorvastatin, s/p iliac stent. 
OK to continue aspirin as well.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Should consider outpatient colonoscopy to potentially identify 
any source of lower GI Bleed.
- Given stable hemoglobin/hematocrit while inpatient as well as 
no evidence of bleeding on EGD, her Xarelto and Aspirin were 
continued on discharge
- Was treated with IV PPI while inpatient, but given no evidence 
of active bleeding, was discharged on home Ranitidine 300mg PO 
daily
- Continue to encourage smoking cessation

pneumothorax, effusion, consolidation or CHF.  There is probable 
osteopenia.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ with a history of CAD, PVD, and 
COPD and history of recurrent chest pain who presented with afib 
with RVR and COPD exacerbation. 
  
ACUTE PROBLEMS:

#COPD exacerbation: Ms. ___ had had two recent ED visits 
for COPD exacerbation, most recently ___ when she was started 
on prednisone 60 mg. She presented to her PCP's office with 
worsening dyspnea despite this therapy and was also complaining 
of nasal congestion, suggesting a viral URI trigger. In clinic 
she was also noted to be in afib with RVR so was referred to the 
ED where she was admitted after control of her heart rate (see 
below). On admission to the floor, she was noted to have 
wheezing, increased work of breathing, and poor air movement. 
She was treated with 125 mg solumedrol and maintained on 60 mg 
PO prednisone daily. Her home theophylline was decreased from 
400 mg BID to ___ mg BID due to concerns it was contributing to 
her tachyarrhythmia. She was placed on ipratropium nebs q6h, 
albuterol nebs q2h, and fluticasone-salmeterol. Pulmonary was 
consulted and recommended a trial of diuresis so she received 10 
mg IV Lasix as well. Azithromycin was not given due to concerns 
for QT prolongation with theophylline and amiodarone (QTc was 
460). She was started on a 5 day course of ceftriaxone instead, 
and discharged to finish the course with cefpodoxime. She was 
discharged with a prednisone taper (10 mg decrease q3d until at 
10 mg, then stay at 10 mg until pulm follow up) as well as 
follow up with pulmonary rehab and a pulmonologist she 
previously followed with, Dr. ___. She was also discharged on 
2L supplemental O2 to be worn at all times. 

#Atrial fibrillation: Ms. ___ has known atrial 
fibrillation for which she was on amiodarone and apixaban but 
was found to have HR in the 120s in her PCP's office, prompting 
her referral to the ED. Her COPD exacerbation was the likely 
precipitant, with medications also possibly contributing, 
particularly theophylline. She was started on a diltiazem gtt in 
the ED to control her rates than transitioned to diltiazem 90 mg 
q6h. After arrival to the floor, her rates remained controlled. 
Her amiodarone and apixaban were continued. Her theophylline was 
decreased to 200 mg BID from 400 mg BID.

#Iron deficiency anemia. Patient was found to have microcytic 
anemia with low iron and ferritin. She was started on IV iron 
125 mg ferric gluconate x4 doses and wasdischarged on PO iron 
with a bowel regimen. Her H/H was stable throughout the 
hospitalized; there was no evidence of bleeding.

Transitional issues:
- patient discharged on prednisone taper: decrease by 10 mg 
every 3 days until at 10 mg, then keep at 10 mg until seen by 
pulmonology
- patient discharged with plan to follow up with pulmonology and 
pulmonary rehab. Can call ___ to schedule appointment 
with pulmonary rehab.
- patient discharged on with 2 days of cefpodoxime to complete 5 
day course of antibiotics for severe COPD exacerbation
- patient discharged with O2 concentrator for continuous home O2
- patient's theophylline decreased from 300 mg BID to ___ mg BID 
due to her afib with RVR; may want to consider further 
theophylline wean, and addition of azithromycin (if QTc is 
decreased as patient also on amiodarone), and/or roflumilast 
therapy
- patient found to be iron deficient, started on IV iron 
repletion, discharged on PO iron
- patient found to have elevated TSH, please follow up free T4 
which was pending on discharge

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were hospitalized at ___ 
because you were having difficulty breathing and were found in 
clinic to have a fast heart rate. Your difficulty breathing was 
due to your COPD flaring. Your fast heart rate was due to your 
atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular heart rate that can 
sometimes cause the heart to beat very quickly. Medications that 
you were taking, such as theophylline, were likely contributing. 
Your heart rate was lowered using the same medication that you 
take at home, diltiazem, given through your IV. 

Your COPD was likely worsened because of a cold. However, your 
flare was very serious requiring IV steroids and many inhaled 
treatments. You should follow up with the lung doctors as ___ 
as with pulmonary rehab to make sure your lung disease is being 
treated as well as possible to prevent you from coming into the 
hospital as often. Please call ___ to schedule an 
appointment with them.

It was a pleasure participating in your care. We wish you all 
the best in the future.

Sincerely,

Your ___ team

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo woman with a PMH notable for COPD on 
home O2(hospitalized ___, multiple recent ED visits), Afib on 
apixaban, HTN, CAD, and HLD who presents with several days of 
worsening dyspnea.

Patient has had several ED visits for dyspnea and a recent 
hospitalization for a COPD exacerbation in ___. She has 
been on steroid therapy with several attempts to taper over the 
last several months. After her most recent ED visit on ___ 
she was on placed on 60 mg PO prednisone with a taper down by 10 
mg each day. Her SOB worsened with the taper and she was seen on 
___ by her PCP who started her on a course of prednisone 30 mg 
PO to be tapered down by 5 mg every 3 days. With the taper she 
is currently on prednisone 25 mg QD.

She reports that her SOB improved slightly after starting the 
steroids on ___. However, last night it acutely worsened and she 
was unable to sleep. She usually uses 3 pillows to sleep but was 
only comfortable seated upright last night. This morning she 
increased her oxygen to 3L and felt better. She is usually on 2L 
NC at home. She reports that for the last several months she has 
been using two different albuterol inhalers each every ___ 
hours. She knows that this is more than they are prescribed for 
but it makes her comfortable. She mostly stays put on the second 
floor of her home. She states that she can walk to the bathroom 
without being short of breath, but does not use the stairs 
unless she has to leave the house because it worsens her 
breathing. She endorses a cough occasionally productive of ___ 
sputum. This is consistent with her baseline. She endorses one 
episode of non-exertional chest pain today that spontaneously 
resolved. She denies fever, chills, recent sick contacts, and 
lower extremity edema.

In the ED, initial vital signs were: T 98.5 P 80 BP 154/97 R 20 
O2 sat 97% NC.  
- Exam notable for: Diffuse expiratory wheezing, prolonged 
expiratory phase, left inspiratory crackles, irregularly 
irregular rhthym, minimal pedal edema  
- Labs were notable for CBC wnl, proBNP 235, Trop 0.02, chem 
notable for bicarb 31, AG 13, UA notable for 40 RBCs  
- Studies performed include CXR with stable mild/moderate 
cardiomegaly, atelectasis at bases, otherwise clear lung fields
- Patient was given Albuterol neb x 1, ipratropium neb x 1, 
Azithromycin 500 mg PO, Prednisone 25 mg PO

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o woman with a PMH notable for COPD on 
home O2 (hospitalized ___, multiple recent ED visits), Afib 
on apixaban, HTN, CAD, and HLD who presented with dyspnea and 
orthopnea in the setting of a steroid taper for recent COPD 
exacerbation. Her dyspnea was thought to be multifactorial due 
to her severe COPD and with a component of anxiety. The patient 
was not thought to be having an acute COPD exacerbation.

================
ACTIVE ISSUES:
================

# Dyspnea: Patient was admitted after one night of worsened 
orthopnea and dyspnea in the setting of a steroid taper from 30 
mg to 25 mg. Her dyspnea was thought to be multifactorial due to 
her severe COPD and with a component of anxiety. The patient was 
not thought to be having an acute COPD exacerbation. The patient 
was treated with occasional duonebs and lorazepam 0.5 mg PRN 
that helped relieve her dyspnea. Pulmonology was consulted. The 
patient underwent CT that showed emphysema but no evidence of 
infection such as ___. The patient was initiated on a steroid 
taper on ___ of prednisone 30 mg for 3 days, then 20 mg for 3 
days, then 10 mg until outpatient follow-up. Pulmonology 
recommended increasing her Advair dose to 500/50, which was 
done. They also recommended switching from theophylline to 
roflumilast and initiation of long-term azithromycin therapy 
provided the patient's QTc was not prolonged; this was deferred 
to the outpatient setting. Throughout her admission she had O2 
sats greater than 95% on 2L NC. She did not desaturate on 
ambulation. 

# Anxiety/Insomnia: Patient with a history of anxiety and 
insomnia, thought to be contributing to her experience of 
dyspnea. The patient was discharged with lorazepam Q8H as needed 
for anxiety. The patient would likely benefit from therapy with 
an SSRI.

# Demand Ischemia: Patient with troponin 0.02, <0.01, then 0.02. 
ECG without acute ischemic changes.

# Microscopic hematuria: On admission the patient had a UA with 
40 RBCs. Occasional UAs over the last year in OMR with 
microscopic hematuria. Would recommend repeat UA as an 
outpatient or work-up for microscopic hematuria.

================
CHRONIC ISSUES:
================

# Smoking: Patient recently quit smoking one month ago. Patient 
was provided with a nicotine patch 7 mg while in house; could 
consider continuing as an outpatient if patient endorses 
cravings.

# Atrial fibrillation: Patient continued on diltiazem 240 mg PO 
BID and apixaban 5 mg BID.

# HTN: Patient with a history of hypertension. Blood pressure 
well-controlled. Continued on isosorbide mononitrate ER 240 mg 
PO daily and hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg PO daily.

# CAD: Cardiac catheterization in ___ without evidence of 
significant stenosis of coronaries. ECHO on ___ with EF>55% 
and no regional or global wall motion abnormalities. The patient 
was continued on aspirin 81 mg daily and atorvastatin 10 mg QPM.

===================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===================
#New Medications:
-Prednisone 30 mg PO QD through ___, then on ___ mg for 3 
days, then on ___ mg until outpatient follow-up
-Increased Advair (Fluticasone-Salmeterol) to 500/50 dose
-Lorazepam 0.5 mg PO Q8H PRN for anxiety

#Follow-up:
-Appointment arranged with PCP, ___ ___
-Appointment arranged with Pulmonologist, Dr. ___, ___

#COPD: Patient was seen by pulmonology during admission who had 
the following recommendations to consider as an outpatient.
-Switch to roflumilast from theophylline
-Daily azithromycin for treatment of chronic inflammation 
provided QTc within normal limits.
-Patient may benefit from treatment of anxiety with an SSRI, as 
her anxiety is likely contributing to her experience of dyspnea.
-In the future, palliative care consult for consideration of 
opioid treatment of dyspnea

#Microscopic hematuria: Patient had a UA with 40 RBCs on 
admission 
-Recommend repeat UA as an outpatient or work-up for microscopic 
hematuria

#Lung nodule: New left lower lobe nodule, potentially measuring 
as large as 6 x 8 mm, warrants close follow-up.  Stable to 
slightly smaller 4 mm right middle lobe nodule. Follow-up CT in 
___ months as per ___ guidelines for evaluation 
of new left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a privilege taking care of you during your admission to 
___. You were admitted to the hospital for 
shortness of breath and concern that you were having a flare of 
your COPD.

While in the hospital we increased your dose of steroids to help 
your breathing. You also received several nebulizer treatments 
that helped your breathing. You were also expressing some 
anxiety that may have been contributing to your shortness of 
breath. You were given a medication called Ativan for your 
anxiety that also seemed to help your breathing.

During your admission you were seen by the pulmonary 
specialists. They recommended a CT scan that showed that you 
have extensive COPD but did not show any infection. They also 
suggested increasing the dose of your Advair inhaler, which we 
did.

If you feel short of breath, first please check your oxygen 
level. If it is less than 90, you can use oxygen and your 
inhaler. If not, try to wait a few minutes, take a few deep 
breaths and see if your shortness of breath improves. You can 
use the medication called Ativan(lorazepam) to help with the 
shortness of breath(no more than three times a day). If still 
not improved, you can use one of the inhalers/oxygen. 

Please follow-up with all your appointments as listed below and 
continue to take all of your medications as prescribed. If you 
experience any of the danger signs listed you should call your 
doctor immediately or go to the Emergency Room.

We wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team

IMAGING:
========
___ CXR:
No acute cardiopulmonary process.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F with history of COPD on home O2, atrial fibrillation on 
apixaban, hypertension, CAD, hyperlipidemia, and recurrent 
hospitalization for COPD exacerbation over the last 4 months, 
who presented with dyspnea and increased wheezing secondary to 
severe COPD.
 
#Recurrent COPD exacerbation: Patient presented with increased 
dyspnea and diffuse wheezing, likely secondary to COPD 
exacerbation. She has a history of multiple recurrent COPD 
hospitalizations. According to Pulmonary, patient has severe 
COPD based on her obstructive deficits on PFTs as well as her 
severe symptoms even at rest, as well as her more frequent 
exacerbations and is likely approaching end-stage disease. We 
continued Advair 500/50 BID, Spiriva, standing nebulizers, and 
theophylline. Pulmonary recommended additional budesonide 
inhalers to allow reduction of PO prednisone dose. Prednisone 
dose was increased back to 40mg (where patient was better) with 
a plan for slow wean by 5mg every 2 weeks. Also, patient was 
started on chronic azithromycin for chronic anti-inflammation; 
after discussion with Dr. ___ was agreed to stop 
azithromycin on discharge due to inability to monitor QT the 
week after discharge, with plan to restart azithromycin once Dr. 
___ is able to see the patient. Patient did not want to go to 
pulmonary rehab. She was seen by Palliative Care who recommended 
initiation of morphine liquid suspension as needed for shortness 
of breath.

# Acute kidney injury: Creatinine was slightly elevated to 1.2 
from a baseline of 1.0. She likely had poor PO intake. 
Creatinine on discharge was 0.9.
 
CHRONIC ISSUES:  
==================  
# Anxiety/Insomnia: We continued home lorazepam.
 
# Atrial fibrillation: We continued diltiazem for rate control 
and apixaban for anticoagulation.  
 
# Hypertension: We continued home imdur, hydrochlorothiazide, 
and diltiazem.  
 
# CAD: Cardiac catheterization in ___ showed no evidence of 
significant stenosis of coronaries. ECHO on ___ showed EF > 
55% and no regional or global wall motion abnormalities. We 
continued home aspirin and atorvastatin.
 
# Anemia: We continued home iron supplements. 

***TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:*** 
- Continue Advair 500/50 BID, Spiriva, and theophylline 
- Make sure patient receives standing nebulizers 
- Added additional budesonide inhalers to allow reduction of PO 
prednisone dose 
- Start chronic azithromycin for chronic anti-inflammation. 
(Patient was started on azithromycin in the hospital and QTc on 
___ was 472 ms. ___ discussion with Dr. ___ was agreed 
to stop azithromycin on discharge due to inability to monitor QT 
the week after discharge, with the plan to restart azithromycin 
once Dr. ___ is able to see the patient.)
- Would recommend audiology testing at some point while patient 
is on chronic azithromycin
- Continue supplemental oxygen for comfort
- Follow up with Dr. ___ discharge 
- Continue Bactrim PPX (1 tab SS daily) given extended courses 
of steroids

Pertinent Results:
CT ABD/PELVIS ___:
Noncontrast imaging of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrates a 
punctate 
nonobstructing calculus in the right collecting system (02:31). 
There is no left renal calculus. There is no evidence of 
ureteral or urinary bladder calculus. There is symmetric renal 
enhancement and excretion of intravenous contrast. Subcentimeter 
cortically based hypodensity in the left interpolar region 
(06:30) is too small to accurately characterize but likely 
represents renal cyst. There is no evidence of collecting system 
filling defect. There are segments of the mid to distal ureters 
are not well opacified, possibly secondary to peristalsis, 
however there is no evidence of inflammatory change or mass 
about the ureters. The adrenal glands are unremarkable. 
  
Low hepatic attenuation on noncontrast imaging is consistent 
with hepatic 
steatosis. There is no evidence of focal hepatic mass. There is 
no 
intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. There 
are numerous gallstones within the gallbladder without evidence 
of acute cholecystitis. 
  
The spleen is not enlarged. There is no pancreatic ductal 
dilatation or 
evidence of pancreatic mass. 
  
There are no dilated loops of bowel. There is no evidence of 
bowel wall 
thickening. There is no intraperitoneal free air or free fluid. 
  
There are no enlarged inguinal, iliac chain, retrocrural, or 
retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Abdominal aorta has a normal course 
and caliber with moderate atherosclerotic calcification. There 
is atherosclerotic calcification of the superior mesenteric 
artery origin. There is no suspicious osseous lesion. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Tiny nonobstructing right collecting system calculus. 
2. Hepatic steatosis. 
3. 3 nodular pulmonary densities in the left basilar region 
measuring up to 8 x 8 mm. These findings may may represent areas 
of rounded atelectasis, however short-term followup with 
nonemergent CT chest is recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ PMH with HTN, GERD, CAD s/p CABG and stenting, IDDM with R 
flank pain presumed to musculoskeletal in nature due to negative 
workup. Incidental UTI / asymptomatic bacturia.

ACUTE ISSUES: 
# UTI / Bacturia: Patient presented without any history of 
urinary or systemic symptoms, but was started on ceftriaxone in 
the ED after U/A with ___ positive and 19 WBCs. 
Antibiotics were taken prior to drawing urinary or blood 
cultures, and there was no yield. Patient switched to 
ciprofloxacin and received a three day total antibiotic course. 
CT scan performed did not have any evidence of pyelonephritis. 
Antibiotics were discontinued at time of discharge.

# Flank Pain: 
Patient reported 3 weeks of back/flank pain, constant and achy 
in nature and worsened by movement. Treated with 
anti-inflammatories with minimal effect. CT scan demonstrated no 
nephrolithiasis. CXR showed no bony abnormality, but could not 
totally exclude multiple rib fractures. Patient's pain was well 
controlled and tolerating PO medications, so she was discharged 
with PCP following for further workup.

# Diabetes / Hyperglycemia:
Patient had persistently 

# IDDM: Last A1C (___) 8.0. Serum glucose initially in the 400s 
and Chem-7 with gap; however, this was likely ___ lactate and 
unlikely to be DKA given normal pH on ABG. AM glucose 218.
- continue home dose lantus 90 units qPM  
- per ___ records, is on a very aggressive ISS, will decrease 
for now and uptitrate as necessary depending on ___  

# ___ on CKD: Cr elevated at 1.4 from baseline 1.0. Most likely 
pre-renal in the setting of infection. Now s/p 2L IVF in the ED 
and creatinine has corrected to 1.0. Appears euvolemic, maybe 
slightly up. 
- consider further workup if no improvement (urine lytes, 
spinning urine, renal u/s)  
- renally dose medications for now  

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# HF with pEF/CAD s/p CABG and stents: Was not an active issue 
whil inpatient. Fluid use was judicious. Metoprolo converted to 
short acting while in house, isosorbide, aspirin and 
atorvastatin were continued. Losartan held as below.  
# HTN: home metoprolol and isosorbide continued, losartan held 
while inpt as pressures were soft and within normal range. 
Discharged home off losartan.
# Restless leg syndrome: home ropinarole continued
# Shoulder pain: oxycodone and tylenol seperately dose while 
inpatient  
# COPD: home advair and PRN albuterol nebs were continued  
# GERD: home pantoprazole continued 
# Insomnia: home trazodone continued  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Losartan held inpatient and at discharge andpatient blood 
pressures were low-normal. PCP to determine restart.
- Patient to follow up with PCP for resolution of UTI and back 
pain symptoms
- Patient should have insulin regiment adjustments for optimal 
glycemic control - no changes to regimen were made at discharge.

IV.
IMPRESSION: Non-anginal type symptoms with no additional ST 
segment changes from baseline.
Imaging:
  Left ventricular cavity size is normal.
  Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake 
throughout the left ventricular myocardium.  The previously 
noted perfusion defect involving the inferolateral wall has 
resolved.
  Gated images reveal normal wall motion. The calculated left 
ventricular ejection fraction is 64%.
IMPRESSION: Normal myocardial perfusion study. Interval 
normalization of prior LCx territory perfusion defect.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ with type 2 diabetes mellitus on insulin, CAD s/p 
MI, S/P multiple PCIs and CABG ___ (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM1; also 
SVG-D1 known occluded ___ with chronic stable angina 
admitted with atypical, stabbing, focal chest pain.

# Chest pain: Initially the patient was started on a heparin 
drip and other ACS protocol medications. Her home losartan and 
furosemide were held due to low blood pressures. Suspicion for 
cardiac etiology of chest pain was ultimately not high. She had 
an isolated ongoing ___ left-sided chest discomfort exacerbated 
by changes in position and with chest wall tenderness to light 
palpation. Despite prolonged chest pain, troponin-T and CK-MB 
negative x2 and EKGs mostly unchanged from prior. Given known 
H/O CAD, a vasodilator nuclear stress test was performed and was 
reassuring. Her discomfort did not change in intensity during 
the stress test drug infusion. In the presence of diffuse ST-T 
wave changes, no additional ECG changes were noted during the 
procedure. The hemodynamic response to the Persantine infusion 
was appropriate. Her perfusion study was normal with interval 
normalization of prior LCx territory perfusion defect. Given the 
stabbing quality and tenderness to palpation of the area of 
discomfort, her symptoms were most likely related to 
costochondritis or other musculoskeletal causes. She was started 
on aspirin 650 mg q6h with plans to trial for 2 days and 
continue through the week if symptoms improve.

Chronic medical problems:
# Diabetes mellitus: Continued levemir and was switched to a 
sliding scale of Humalog.
# Hypertension: Losartan was held as above due to hypotension 
and once daily isosorbide mononitrate was switched temporarily 
to isosorbide dinitrate TID. 
# For her hyperlipidemia, COPD and GERD, her home regimens were 
continued.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient had low blood pressures initially (88-92 systolic). 
Would benefit from close monitoring and titration of blood 
pressure medications as an outpatient
- She was hypokalemic (K 3.0) during admission (with ___ and 
furosemide already held). Please recheck CHEM-10 at ___ ___ 
visit on ___ to determine whether she might benefit from K 
supplementation
- Cr elevated to 1.2 on discharge (up from most recent 1.1.1). 
Please recheck at ___ office on ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was our pleasure participating in your care here at ___. 
You were admitted with severe chest pain. You underwent a stress 
test that showed the pain is unlikely from a big blockage in the 
arteries that feed your heart. Your lab work also did not 
suggest injury to the heart.

The pain you are experiencing is most likely musculoskeletal and 
should hopefully improve with supportive measures such as 
Tylenol (maximum 3 grams per day) and time. You will also be 
prescribed high dose aspirin (650mg). Please try this for two 
days and if there is improvement in your symptoms continue it 
for the week. 

If your symptoms worsen, you develop shortness of breath or any 
other concerning symptom, please let your doctor know right 
away.

Again, it was our pleasure participating in your care.

We wish you the very ___,

SVG-OM1, SVG-D1(occluded) ___, HFpEF, IDDM, HTN who 
presented with several days atypical chest pain both with 
exertion and at rest, with mild T wave deepening but no other 
EKG changes or troponin. She also presented with mild DKA and 
diabetic foot ulcer. She had a stress test with reversible 
ischemia in the LAD territory (___) and went to cardiac 
catheterization ___ which showed stable disease and no new 
obstructive lesions. Overall her chest pain was felt to have 
been either musculoskeletal or demand in the setting of DKA and 
diabetic foot ulcer. She was discharged on ASA 81, atorvastatin 
80, Metoprolol XL 100mg daily. 

#DKA/IDDM: Patient presented with anion gap metabolic acidosis 
and felt to be in mild DKA. She had insulin gtt in the ED but 
was rapidly switched to subcutaneous insulin. Her A1c returned 
at 12%, which is the highest it has been recorded for her in our 
records. She had followed with ___ previously and was 
on canagliflozin and glipizide as well as SC insulin prior to 
admission. However, she reported intermittent adherence to her 
medications and this was the likely reason for her DKA. While 
she was in house the ___ followed along and she met 
with a diabetes educator. Her canagliflozin was stopped at 
discharge due to increased risk of amputation. 

#Diabetic foot ulcer: Present for at least 3 weeks prior to 
admission. She underwent bedside debridement by Podiatry in ED. 
XR suggested presence of osteomyelitis . She was maintained on 
vanc/cefepime/flagyl in house, and was switched to cipro/clinda 
at discharge per podiatry recs with plans for close follow up. 
Her wound swab at time of discharge was polymicrobial but was 
growing Group B strep (sensitivities pending) and klebsiella 
(pan sensitive). 

#Med noncompliance: She reported intermittent medication 
compliance related to difficulty remembering to take her 
medications as well as periods of depression and stress where 
taking her medication was not a priority. She has recently 
obtained a pillbox and her granddaughter is helping her with 
remembering to take her medications. 

#HFpEF: Metoprolol as above, continued torsemide 20mg and she 
appeared euvolemic throughout admission. 
#HL: Continued atorvastatin
#HTN: Metoprolol lowered to XL 100mg daily, losartan kept at 
25mg daily. Imdur stopped.
#COPD: Duonebs q6h in house, continued home inhalers on 
discharge. 
#Restless legs: continued ropinerole 

Transitional issues: 
- Please follow up her diabetic foot ulcer in ___ clinic. 
Plan at time of discharge was to take to OR for further surgical 
debridement, patient was discharged with cipro/clinda until 
Podiatry follow up 
- Please review her blood sugars at home and continue to 
reinforce compliance with diabetes medications. Her 
Canagliflozin was stopped due to increased risk of amputation. 
Consider reintroducing metformin as this was stopped ___ years ago 
for diarrhea but may be a better option for her. 
- Follow up blood pressures and heart rate on the current 
regimen. Suspect that due to noncompliance her medications were 
uptitrated to higher doses than she actually needs. We cut back 
her Metoprolol and stoped her imdur
- Can restart imdur if requiring for chest pain on outpatient 
basis
- Please continue to work with patient on med compliance and 
possible barriers. She denied depression with our social worker 
but does endorse that stress makes it hard to take her 
medications. 
- f/u final wound swab cultures

Brief Hospital Course:
=============
SUMMARY
=============

___ yo F with hx of DMII, HTN who presented with diabetic foot 
ulcer on her left hallux complicated by osteomyelitis. She 
underwent surgical debridement and partial tissue and bone 
removal on ___. However the infection persisted, and she 
underwent left hallux amputation on ___. She was started 
on IV nafcillin for MSSA infection with plan to continue home 
infusions of nafcillin until at least ___

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
#Osteomyelitis of left hallux: Due to diabetic ulcer of left 
hallux. Patient underwent partial left hallux amputation on ___ 
by podiatry. She was initially placed on IV Vancomycin, Flagyl, 
and cefepime. Initial surgical cultures came back positive for 
MSSA, so was changed to IV nafcillin. Patient continued to be 
afebrile, but her left foot continued to have erythema, edema, 
pain, and the ulcer was not healing well. There was concern for 
poor arterial blood flow and therefore underwent noninvasive 
arterial studies on bilateral lower extremities. The studies 
showed mild atherosclerotic disease in her left leg and foot, 
and severe atherosclerotic disease in her right leg and foot. 
Vascular surgery was consulted for potential intervention, but 
they felt that no further vascular intervention was warranted 
prior to podiatric surgery. The patient was brought back to the 
OR by podiatry on ___ for total left hallux amputation 
given lack of clinical improvement. Her ___ blood cell count 
continued to down trend. The pathology report showed clean 
margins. However, patient was continuing to have pain, and there 
was increased erythema and swelling around surgical site. An MRI 
of the left foot was done, which showed devitalization of the 
surgical flap, some edema, and a hyperintense focal spot at the 
site of the surgery. There were no signs of abscess or fluid 
collection. Podiatry team felt patient did not need any acute 
surgical intervention and will have close follow-up on 
___. A PICC line was placed in the right arm 
___ with tentative plan to complete a two-week course of IV 
nafcillin on ___. For the wound, podiatry recommends daily 
dressing changes to left foot surgical site: Betadine moistened 
gauze, 4x4 gauze, and kerlix.

#Cough: During her stay the patient developed cough that was 
nonproductive. It was thought to be due to atelectasis after 
surgery, especially since her rales on exam would clear with 
coughing. A repeat chest x-ray was negative for any acute 
cardiopulmonary processes and on comparison to previous chest 
x-ray during this hospital stay there were no changes. Will 
restart home Lasix at discharge.

#Hypertension: Patient's antihypertensives were held upon 
admission given that her blood pressures were low with systolic 
blood pressures in the ___ likely due to sepsis in the 
setting of her osteomyelitis from her diabetic foot ulcer. After 
her first debridement, patient's blood pressures increase to 
160s-170s so we restarted her losartan and furosemide. However 
her blood pressure dipped back down again to the ___ systolic 
and her creatinine bumped up to 1.8 so we discontinued her 
losartan and furosemide. Her metoprolol was continued with 
holding parameters, and it was held when her systolic blood 
pressure was less than 110. Her ___ resolved, and she became 
hypertensive again, so we restarted her losartan while in the 
hospital and instructed the patient to restart her Lasix upon 
discharge from the hospital.

#Acute Kidney Injury: Her baseline creatinine is 1.0. It bumped 
up to 1.8 in the setting of sepsis, restarting her losartan and 
furosemide, and hypotension. We gave her IV fluids and stopped 
her losartan and furosemide. Her creatinine continued to improve 
with these measures and upon discharge it was 1.1-1.2, which is 
around her baseline.

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
#Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: Upon admission, patient was started 
on 80% of home insulin doses. Her Lantus inpatient dose was 32 
units, and her Humalog inpatient dose was 12 units 3 times 
daily. Patient's blood sugars were hard to control while she was 
inpatient. Working with the ___ diabetes consult team we 
adjusted her insulin doses as needed. ___ recommended 
discharging the patient on 48 units of Toujeo and 18 units of 
Novolog with meals as well as resuming her Trajenta and 
Jardiance.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[ ] Patient is on oxycodone 5 mg Q8H for her foot pain from the 
surgery. She was given enough to get her to her PCP appointment, 
which is ___. Please re-assess pain management.

[ ] Osteomyelitis, infected diabetic foot ulcer: Surgical margin 
from total left hallux amputation on ___ was negative for 
osteomyelitis. Patient to complete a 2 week course of nafcillin 
for ongoing soft tissue infection and will follow up with ID 
prior to completion of antibiotics to ensure resolution. Will be 
discharged on q4 hour nafcillin to be infused via a pump. Once 
finished an antibiotic should also have right arm PICC line 
removed. For the wound, podiatry recommends daily dressing 
changes to left foot surgical site: Betadine moistened gauze, 
4x4 gauze, and kerlix

[ ] Diabetes mellitus type 2: Patient's blood sugars were very 
labile. Given that she came in with a diabetic foot ulcer 
suggesting that her blood sugars are not well-controlled at 
home, she needs close follow-up to optimize her diabetic 
medication regimen. She is being discharged on reduced dose 
Toujeo and regular home Novolog along with her usual Trajenta 
and Jardiance with close follow-up with ___ provider on 
___, ___ at 1 ___. Please reassess patient's need for 
Jardiance given history of recurrent AKIs

[ ] Cough: Patient developed non-productive cough while in 
hospital but afebrile, no leukocytosis, CXR no signs of pleural 
effusion or consolidation. Suspect due to atelectasis in post-op 
period after foot surgery. Will discharge on incentive 
spirometer and restarting home Lasix as outpatient. If not 
improved once back on outpatient Lasix, would consider further 
workup.

[ ] Hypertension: Patient was discharged on her regular home 
medications. While she was an inpatient, she became hypotensive 
when we restarted her on all of her antihypertensives. Please 
follow her blood pressure to ensure that she is on the right 
regimen. If too low, might consider removing furosemide.

[ ] ___: Discharge creatinine 1.2 on ___. Suspect patient will 
have a slight bump in creatinine after restarting losartan on 
___. Patient had weekly labs checked with IV antibiotic 
infusions. If continues to rise, may be due to nafcillin and 
would consider switching antibiotic to cefazolin.

EKG:
Sinus rhythm at a rate of 69. Normal axis. The PR interval is 
prolonged at 204ms (slightly more than prior ekg). Q wave in 
III. Non-specific ST and T changes.

Nuclear Stress Test: 
INTERPRETATION:  
The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and 
breast attenuation. There is activity adjacent to the heart in 
the rest and stress images. 
Left ventricular cavity size is increased. 
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a reversible, moderate 
reduction in photon counts involving the mid and basal 
inferolateral walls and the distal lateral wall. Gated images 
reveal normal wall motion.  
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 52% with an 
EDV of 107 ml (reprocessed at workstation).  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Reversible, medium sized, moderate severity perfusion defect 
involving the LCx territory. 
2. Increased left ventricular cavity size with normal systolic 
function. 
Compared to the prior study of ___, the defect is new. 
.
Cardiac catheterization:
COMMENTS:      
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system 
demonstrated three-vessel coronary artery disease.  The ___ did 
not 
have angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses.  The LAD 
had 60% 
in-stent restenosis at the junction of the old Cypher stent 
placed in 
___ and the new Promus stent placed in ___ the D2 branch was 
jailed 
with 60% origin stenosis.  The LCx had a 50% stenosis at its 
origin; 
there was a 90% stenosis of the OM1 branch.  The mid-RCA had a 
50% 
stenosis. 
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic arterial 
hypertension, with a central aortic pressure of 142/74 mmHg. 
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of OM1 with a 3.0x15mm PROMUS 
stent 
which was postdilated to 3.5mm. Final angiography revealed no 
residual 
stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III 
flow (see 
PTCA comments). 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Successful PTCA and stenting of the OM1 with a DES. 
.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
# Unstable angina: Description of the pain was somewhat atypical 
for angina in that she experiences in when she lays down and it 
is also reproducible. However, given her history of CAD status 
post multiple PCIs and many risk factors, the patient underwent 
stress test to rule out CAD. Nuclear stress test showed a 
reversible, medium sized, moderate severity perfusion defect 
involving the left circumflex territory. In light of these 
stress test findings, the patient underwent cardiac 
catheterization. Prior to cardiac catheterization, she was 
prehydrated given her acute kidney injury. The patient had a 
drug-eluting stent placed to the obtuse marginal branch. The 
patient became acutely hypertensive during cardiac 
catheterization and was started on a nitroglycerin drip (see 
discussion below). The patient was weaned from this quickly. The 
patient was continued on aspirin (full-dose), plavix, 
metoprolol, and imdur. Her home dose of atorvastatin was 
increased given evidence of coronary artery disease. Serial 
cardiac enzymes were negative times 3.
   OUTPATIENT ISSUES: Patient is to continue taking aspirin 
325mg and plavix 75mg daily for the next year. Patient will have 
cardiology follow-up as an outpatient with the ___ 
___ ___ group in ___. 
.  
# Acute kidney injury: Creatinine currently 1.7, up from 1.4 in 
___. Renal function previously was normal. Upon admission, 
the patient's lisinopril and furosemide were discontinued. Of 
note, hte patient was started on furosemide approximately ___ 
months ago, which coincides with the development of the 
patient's elevated serum creatinine. Serum creatinine was 
trended through the admission and improved. The patient was 
restarted on her home lisinopril, though her serum creatinine 
was noticed to be increasing so was discontinued with 
instructions to restart this medication after follow-up with her 
primary care physician. The patient was instructed to have a 
basic metabolic panel drawn ___. 
.  
# Diastolic heart failure: Patient was euvolemic through her 
admission. Her home lasix was discontinued during this admission 
given her acute kidney injury. The patient will follow-up with 
her primary care physician regarding ___ of lasix. 
   OUTPATIENT ISSUES: Outpatient BMP for monitoring of serum 
creatinine and reinitiation of lasix by the primary care 
physician. 
.  
# Type 2 Diabetes Melltius, insulin dependent: Moderately 
controlled with last A1c 7.9% in ___. Lantus and sliding 
scale was continued through the hospitalization. She was 
discharged home on her home doses of lantus and her home insulin 
sliding scale.   
.
# Hypertension: Through most of the patient's admission, her 
blood pressure was  well controlled (goal <130/80). She was 
continued on metoprolol and imdur, though furosemide and 
lisinopril were discontinued in light of the patient's elevated 
serum creatinine. However, during the patient's cardiac 
catheterization, she was noted to have elevated systolic blood 
pressures and was started on a nitroglycerin drip for control of 
blood pressures. The patient was weaned from the nitroglycerin 
drip with in 4 hours after cardiac catheterization. The patient 
received a dose of lisinopril, but because of rising serum 
creatinine, the patient's next dose was held. 
   OUTPATIENT ISSUES: Follow-up with primary care physician 
regarding recent hospitalization and anti-hypertensive regimen 
in light of elevated serum creatinine.  
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Well controlled with last LDL 50 in ___ 
(goal LDL<70), though triglycerides mildly elevated.  
Atorvastatin was increased to 80mg daily given the new CAD 
lesions. Patient also had a fasting lipid panel that was drawn, 
which was pending at time of discharge.
   OUTPATIENT ISSUES: Follow-up of pending fasting lipid panel.  

. 
# COPD: Currently asymptomatic. Patient was continue fluticasone 
and albuterol as needed.

CABG, presenting with chest pain and rising troponins, with new 
ST depressions inferiorly in V4-V6, consistent with NSTEMI.  
Patient's troponins plateaued at 0.13.  She has initiated on a 
heparin gtt in the ED, and was taken to cardiac cath the 
following morning.  Catheterization showed occlusion of the SVG 
to the diagonal, possibly causing her current symptoms.  No 
intervention was performed.  Patient was medically optimized 
with increased metoprolol, initiation of losartan, and 
initiation of imdur.  Other potential causes of her chest pain 
were considered including PE (ruled out with negative CTA), 
pericarditis (symptoms consistent, but exam and EKG not 
consistent, also patient has been essentially treated as she has 
been taking consistent NSAIDs), costochondritis (symptoms 
intermittently reproducible on exam), or pleuritis secondary to 
pleural effusion (very small effusion, stable since CABG).  
   If pain persists, patient was instructed to speak with her 
cardiologist about increasing imdur should her blood pressure 
tolerate.  
  
# Acute renal insufficiency- On admission, creatinine elevated 
to 1.2, likely due to dehydration, as creatinine improved 
overnight with gentle fluids and remained stable. 

# COPD- Continued on home inhalers (albuterol, fluticasone)

# DM- Continued with glargine 50 units Q6 and ISS  

# HLD- Continued on home atorvastatin 

# GERD- Continued on home pantoprazole

# Transitional issues-
- NEW MEDICATIONS- losartan and imdur
- MEDICATION CHANGES- metoprolol increased to 50mg po TID (from 
25 TID)
- if ongoing chest pain, consider titrating up on imdur if c/w 
anginal pain.   Also may consider treating for costochondritis 
and pericarditis

ACTIVE ISSUES:
  
Chest pain: patient with high coronary risk, however recent cat 
6 months ago did not reveal interveneable disease.  Fact that 
she is having reproducability on physical exam suggests non 
cardiac cause, however symptoms are complicated by patient's 
history of cognitive impairment.  Given known CAD with 70% 
stenosis stress echo was performed to assess for functional 
abnormality with exertion.  No ECHO abnormalities were noted 
although pt reported atypical chest pain with stress.  She was 
continued on home ASA, plavix, statin, nitrate and metoprolol 
while in-house.  She was monitored on tele without any alarms.  
She was discharged home after a negative stress to follow-up 
with her PCP and ___.

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
 
# Diastolic CHF (EF>50%): No signs of fluid overload currently.  
Not on baseline diuresis.  She was continued on home BB and ___

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___-

You came to the hospital with chest pain.  You had lab chests 
and EKG's that were reassuring that you were not having a heart 
attack.  While you were here, you had a stress test which did 
not suggest any evidence of worsening coronary artery disease.  
Your chest pain was reproducible with touching your chest, which 
is not typical of coronary artery disease pain.  This likely is 
related to musculoskeletal pain.  
Some changes have been made to your medication list.  Please 
followup with your cardiologist for further medication changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ y/o F with PMHx CHF, Afib not on 
anticoagulation, severe advanced Alzheimer's dementia, 
osteoporosis, HTN, who presents from assisted living facility 
with R hip pain, found to have DVT left common femoral vein with 
volume overload. During a meeting with patient and her family, 
decision was made to transition care to comfort-directed 
measures only and to pursue hospice services on discharge. 

ACTIVE ISSUES 
=============
# CMO. The team had a family meeting on ___ and decision was 
made to transition care to CMO and pursue 24 hour hospice 
services on discharge. Family did not want to pursue active 
treatments such as Lasix, which would make her uncomfortable 
given incontinence or shots such as lovenox for treatment of 
DVT. Home medications metoprolol, donepezil and Memantine were 
continued for comfort. She was discharged to an ___ 
___ facility. 

OTHER HOSPITAL ISSUES 
=====================

# DVT. Deep vein thrombosis of the left common femoral vein 
extending into at least the popliteal vein diagnosed on 
ultrasound on admission. This was likely acquired in the setting 
of immobility, as the patient had been restricted to her 
wheelchair at her assisted living for greater than 1 month due 
to deconditioning. She was initially started on Lovenox for 
treatment but this was discontinued in the setting of transition 
to care to CMO as above. 

# Acute CHF. Patient was volume overloaded on presentation with 
pleural effusions. She was diuresed with IV Lasix. Home 
metoprolol was continued at a decreased dose. In the setting of 
transition to care to CMO, Lasix was discontinued. She was 
continued on metoprolol for comfort. She remained on room air 
without respiratory distress.  

# Afib. She presented in sinus rhythm, rate controlled on 
metoprolol. Metoprolol was continued at a decreased dose for 
comfort. 

# Hip pain. The right hip pain that she presented with was 
resolved by the time of admission. Pelvic xray was without 
fracture. She was treated with Tylenol scheduled for pain 
control. 

# Al___ Dementia. She was AOx1 at her baseline per family 
members. She was continued on Aricept/Namenda.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 
===================

- ___ facility to continue writing orders for 
pain/anxiety/secretions and other symptoms. 
- Continued metoprolol succinate and Memantine and donepezil on 
discharge for comfort. Continuation of these medications can be 
further decided at inpatient hospice. 
- MOLST form: DNR/DNI, do not re-hospitalize

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ year-old female with a history of NSCLC 
(stage IV) who presents with shortness of breath.
.
The patient was in her usual state of health until the evening 
before admission when she began to feel somewhat short of 
breath.  The next morning, this sensation persisted, so she 
became concerned.  She also reports a few day history of a 
non-productive cough.  Denies sick contacts, recent travel or 
sedentary lifestyle.  She denied chest pain, fever, chills, 
dizziness, lightheadedness or syncope.  She presented to the ED 
where she was found to be hypoxic to the ___ on room air.
.  
In the ED, she was placed on a non-rebreather with sats up to 
the high 90's.  Attempts were made to wean her to NC but they 
were unsuccessful, as she was satting 88% on 4L NC.  She 
remained afebrile in the ED but was found to have WBC of 17.  
Given that, she received levofloxacin and vancomycin.  Blood 
cultures were drawn prior to antibiotic administration.  CXR did 
not show PNA, but demonstrated progression of known lung cancer. 
 She underwent a CT head to rule out metastases, which was 
negative.  On transfer, patient was afebrile with HR- 77, BP- 
112/49, RR- 16, SaO2- 98% on 15L NRB  
.
On transfer to the ICU, the patient was stable and comfortable.  
Sats were 97% on 5L NC and 95% high-flow with a face-tent.  
.  
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change, 
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, 
melena, hematochezia, chest pain, orthopnea, PND, lower 
extremity edema, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, 
lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision 
changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

improvement in the consolidation of the superior segment of the 
right lower lobe and nodular densities of the left lower lobe.  
Still widely disseminated BAC. 
-- ___ CT Chest shows increased density of right lower lobe
consolidation and worsened peribronchiolar ground-glass 
opacities
in the lingula are most consistent with worsening of widely
disseminated non-small cell lung cancer, much less likely due to
infection.

CXR: ___
SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Patient is status post median 
sternotomy. The 
cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There 
continues to be progression of disease with increased extent of 
consolidative opacity within the right lung base. Ill-defined 
opacities within the lingula and left lower lobe are similar to 
prior. Small right pleural effusion is present. There is no 
pneumothorax. There is hyperinflation of the lungs. 
IMPRESSION: Evidence of disease progression. 
.
CT Head: ___
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass 
effect or 
recent infarction. An area of encephalomalacia in the left 
frontal lobe, 
compatible with chronic infarct is unchanged. Prominence of the 
ventricles 
and sulci reflects generalized atrophy, notably in the bifrontal 
extraaxial spaces. Areas of periventricular and subcortical 
white matter hypodensity likely reflect sequela of chronic small 
vessel ischemic disease. No concerning osseous lesion is seen. 
There are calcifications of the bilateral carotid siphons. The 
visualized paranasal sinuses are grossly unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process or mass 
effect 
.
LENIs: ___
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT. 
.
CT chest ___
IMPRESSION:  
1. Interval worsening of diffuse bilateral ground-glass 
opacities, 
bronchiolar nodules and dense consolidation within the lingula 
and right 
middle lobe. After review of multiple recent prior chest x-rays 
and CTs, these findings can all be explained by worsening 
bronchioalveolar carcinoma, given the absence of any change 
rapid enough to suggest pneumonia. Of course pneumonia might be 
present and unrecognized, and treatment should be made on the 
basis of clinical findings. 
2. Stable mild cardiomegaly. 
3. Moderate emphysema. 
4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with NSCLC stage IV presents with hypoxia.
.
#. Hypoxia. On admission patient with chief complaints of 
progressive shortness of breath and non-productive cough. No 
home oxygen requirement at baseline. On admission she was placed 
on NRB for treatment of O2 saturations in ___ saturations in the 
___.  Admission CXR with no definite infiltrate, though concern 
for progression of her known lung disease. In setting of 
elevated WBC. concern for infectious process and empirically 
treated with levofloxacin and vancomycin in the ED. Transitioned 
to monotherapy with levofloxacin on ___ and ceftriaxone was 
later added on ___. CXR on ___ demonstrates new left lower 
lobe consolidation. Additional hypoxia work-up notable for 
negative biomarkers, negative LENIs; unable to perform CTA due 
to chronic kidney disease and creatinine 2.8. Patient was able 
to be weaned back to room air by the end of her FICU stay. She 
was transferred to the medical floor on ___, where she 
demonstrated exertional hypoxia, usually asymptomatic. Home O2 
was arranged.
.
# Post-obstructive pneumonia. Consolidation of left lower lobe 
evident on ___ likely secondary to infection rather than 
progression of disease due to short time course of infiltrate 
development (although on CT scan of ___, the radiologist 
concluded the opposite: that changes seen were likely caused by 
her NSCLC, though pneumonia could not be absolutely ruled out). 
Continued course of ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, which was 
eventually narrowed to levofloxacin alone. Blood cultures no 
growth to date. Multiple sputum cultures obtained; however, all 
contaminated with oral flora. Urine legionella negative. Patient 
did improve clinically with antibiotics, so she should complete 
a ___ day course of levofloxacin.
.
#  NSCLC- stage IV. Not currently receiving chemotherapy.  
Outpatient oncologist Dr. ___ is planning on continued 
surveillance with plan for possible further palliative systemic 
chemotherapy if symptomatic progression of her disease is noted. 
CT scan for evaluation of disease progression was obtained and 
did show further progression. Dr. ___ plans to weigh the risks 
and benefits of additional chemotherapy, as it will be 
complicated by her kidney dysfunction and other comorbidities. 
He plans to repeat her CT scan once she completes her 
antibiotics to further evaluate the rate of disease progression.
.    
#  CAD s/p MI. Patient without chest pain; however, EKG with new 
ST-depressions. Biomarkers cycled and negative x2. Patient 
continued on home beta-blocker at a decreased dose due to 
relative hypotension. She was maintained on aspirin, plavix, and 
statin.
.
# chronic systolic CHF (LVEF ___ by TTE ___: 
Well-compensated. As described below, lasix was held but 
B-blocker was given at a lower dose given relative hypotension 
and exertional tachycardia.
.
#  CKD stage III: Creatinine on admission 2.8, down to 2.4 by 
the time of discharge. She was given minimal IV fluids in the 
ICU and her lasix was held. Throughout stay, patient had 
adequate urine output. 
.
#  Microcytic anemia. On presentation, patient's Hct likely 
hemoconcentrated. Follow-up Hct found to be 20. No signs of 
bleeding on exam. Patient transfused 2units of pRBC due to 
history of CAD with appropriate elevation in hematocrit. The 
hematocrit did remain steady during FICU course following 
tranfusion. Just before transfer from ___, the patient's stool 
guaiac was positive, which may call for further work-up. The 
patient's anemia is most likely secondary to acute inflammation 
in the setting of underlying chronic disease.

History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ yo female with a past medical history of 
CAD with a 1 vessel CABG (SVG to LAD) in ___ who presents with 
chest pressure.  She woke up at 8 am with substernal chest 
pressure.  It was severe initially.  She took SL NTG x3 with 
relief of CP for a short period of time.  The CP radiated to her 
right side and eventually down both arms.  She reports 
diaphoresis, but denied associated nausea, vomiting, 
lightheadedness or dizziness.  She reports that she has felt 
mildly SOB since her recent pneumonia (first diagnosed appox ___ 
weeks ago).  She denied worsening dyspnea.  Her cough has 
improved substantially and is very minimal at this time.  She 
went to her PCP's office and was found to have a new LBBB and 
anterior ST elevations.  She was transferred to the ED. She 
received Plavix 300mg, Aspirin, boluses of heparin and 
integrillin. Code STEMI was called and went to the cath lab.  
Cath showed occluded SVG, Native 3vd, occluded proximal LAD. 
Wiring the LAD was difficult and there was concern about a 
possible dissection. One BMS was placed in the proximal LAD. 
Distal LAD is diminutive past ___ septal and diag branches.   
She has been hemodynamically stable with HR 60-70s and SBP 
120-130s.  On the floor, she is currently chest pain free and 
feels well.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ yo female with a history of CAD who 
presented with an STEMI s/p catheterization and was incidentally 
found to have multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with 
adenocarcinoma.  

#. STEMI: Pt presented with an anterior STEMI.  Her TIMI risk 
score was 7 indicating a 41% risk at 14 days of mortality, new 
or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent 
revascularization.  Her SVG found to be completely occluded and 
a BMS was placed in the proximal LAD.  Due to the timing of the 
SVG placement over ___ years ago, it was thought that her LAD had 
managed to self revascularize and was partially supplied by the 
RCA.  She was started on routine ACS medications: eptifibatide 
for 18 hrs, plavix 75 and aspirin 325mg, metoprolol, captopril, 
and atorvastatin.  Cardiac enzymes trended down appropriately 
with peak Ck and CKMB at 107 and 18.2.  There was concern for 
acute heart failure from ischemic insult oxygen requirement.  
However, she was noted to also have a RLL pneumonia and no 
significant pulmonary edema (see below).  ECHO showed moderate 
to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
anterior and anterospetal akinesis and inferior/inferolateral 
hypokinesis.  Initially, patient  was started on coumadin for 
ventricular thrombus prophylaxis, but this was subsequantly 
discontinued as risk of bleeding outweighed benefit. 

# Hypoxia:  Upon hospitalization, patient was maintaing 
saturations in low ___ on 6L from baseline 92% on RA.  CXR 
showed RLL pneumonia, and patient was subsequantly started on 
ceftriaxone, azithromycin, metronidazole.  As the patient had 
history recurrent RLL pneumonia, a CT scan was obtained which 
showed severe right lower lobe consolidation and extensive, new 
diffuse lung nodules with  sputum cytology positive for 
adenocarcinoma.  Hypoxia was initially felt to be a combination 
of postobstructive pneumonia and tumor burden from 
adenocarcinoma.  Antibiotics were changed to vancomycin, 
levofloxacin and flagyl of which she completed a 10 day course.  
Repeat CT scan showed little interval improvement in right lower 
lobe infiltrate.  Respiratory status remained tenuous, patient 
requiring high flow O2 with 6LNC with desaturations to high ___ 
with activity.  Prior to discharge O2 requirement was 5L by 
nasal cannula.  She was breathing comfortably with oxygen 
saturation in the low ___.  Likely this will continue to be 
necessary for some time.  A shovel mask may be used to assist 
with oxygenation as needed.     

# Lung nodules/ Broncheoalveolar carcinoma: CT scan with diffuse 
pulmonary nodules and sputum cytology positive for 
adenocarcinoma.  Etiology was felt to be primary 
bronchioalveolar vs metastatic thyroid dx (prior dx of possible 
microfollicular carcinoma) although routine cancer screening was 
not up-to-date.  A tissue diagnosis was not attained given the 
patient's high oxygen requirement and anticoagulation with 
plavix/asa in the setting of recent ___ placement.  Although 
patient did not have imaging of her head, staging based on CT 
torso was IIIa with pulmonary nodules in both lung fields 
without obvious distal LAD or metastasis.  Empiric therapy with 
single agent chemotherapy was initiated on ___ with 
Pemetrexed.  She tolerated this well.  She received 
dexamethasone on ___ to prevent rash.   

# Chronic renal insufficiency - Patient with GFR 48.  
Medications were renally dosed and renal function was carefully 
followed.  She was treated prophylactically with mucomyst prior 
to and post IV contrast dose.  Creatinine remained stable at 
___.  

# Hyperkalemia:  The patient was mildly hyperkalemic the day 
prior to discharge to 5.6 without EKG changes.   This responded 
promptly to kayexalate.  Electrolytes should be checked daily 
until stable.  If necessary ACEI could be stopped.

# HTN:  She was normotensive on ACEI and b-blocker.  

 
Medications on Admission:
# Clopidogrel [Plavix] 75 mg Tablet PO Daily
# Ezetimibe-Simvastatin [Vytorin ___ 10 mg-20 mg PO daily     
 
# Nifedipine 30 mg SR PO qday
# Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg/hour Patch 24 hr 1 patch once a day   
# Nitroglycern sublingual tabs PRN - has not used recently prior

absence of 
recent comparable studies, new pneumonia would be difficult to 
recognize in the right lower and middle lobes. 

CT Chest ___: 
1. Increased bronchial and peribronchial nodules with 
ground-glass halos 
since ___, predominating upper and middle lobes, most 
consistent with infection. 
2. Stable right lower lobe reticular opacities with areas of 
consolidation 
and widespread nodules predominantly involving the right upper 
and middle 
lobes, consistent with known bronchioalveolar cell carcinoma. 
3. Stable large left thyroid mass. 
4. Stable abdominal aortic intimal calcification displacement. 
5. Stable renal cysts. Miniscule nonobstructive right renal 
calculus. 
6. Moderate emphysema.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with stage IV lung adenoca, CAD who presented 
with fever at home.

#. Fever: She presented with ___ weeks of fatigue, nonproductive 
cough that is chronic, and 1 day of fevers.  Chest xray was 
unremarkable but could not rule out infection given the location 
of her lung cancer.  She had negative blood and urine cultures.  
She underwent CT chest on admission, as she was due for a repeat 
CT scan the following week routinely.  The CT chest was 
concerning for a new infectious process in the right upper and 
middle lobes, as well as stable areas of consolidation and 
nodules consistent with bronchioalveolar carcinoma.  She was 
started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin and was discharged on 
cefuroxime and azithromycin.  She was also discharged on home 
oxygen (she already used oxygen sometimes at home and was 
instructed to use it full-time after discharge).

#. Acute renal failure: She had an elevated creatinine on 
admission to 2.5 from a recent baseline of 1.3-1.8.  This was 
felt to be prerenal azotemia and it improved with IV hydration.  
However, she still has new renal insufficiency and would likely 
benefit from follow-up with nephrology after discharge.  She was 
also instructed to follow a low potassium diet.

#. Hyponatremia: She had low serum sodium on admission, felt to 
be related to hypovolemia in the setting of her illness.  Her 
sodium improved to normal levels with IV fluids.

#. Stage IV Lung Adenocarcinoma: She is s/p 6 cycles of 
pemetrexed.  She should follow-up with her primary oncologist 
for further treatment.

#. Anemia: She was given 1 unit of PRBCs for anemia on 
admission.  Her anemia was felt to be related to her recent 
chemotherapy.

#. CAD: She was continued on a statin, aspirin, and clopidogrel.

#. HTN: She was continued on amlodipine.

IMAGING:
===================
Unilat lower extremity vein- R ___
Right calf veins not visualized. Otherwise, no evidence of deep
venous thrombosis in the right lower extremity veins.

CT RLE ___
Unremarkable contrast enhanced CT of the right calf with a two 
vessel runoff to the foot. 
The veins of the lower extremity are not opacified therefore 
cannot be assessed for patency.  Consider repeat ultrasound to 
more fully evaluate. 
No focal collection or obvious muscular abnormality identified 
by CT

___:
1..  Uneventful ultrasound-guided injection of long-acting 
anesthetic and
steroid into theright greater trochanteric bursa.
2.  Prior injection, small amount of fluid in the right greater 
trochanteric
bursa and dystrophic calcification within the bursal space.  
Findings raise
suspicion for chronic trochanteric bursitis.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
==================
Ms. ___ is a ___ with a PMH significant for 
antiphospholipid syndrome with DVTs and PEs on Coumadin, recent 
L-sided breast cancer s/p lumpectomy, who presented to the ED 
with acute on chronic right lower extremity and right hip pain, 
making it difficult to ambulate. Right lower extremity U/S and 
CT did not reveal a DVT though calf veins were not well 
visualized. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==================
# Right trochanteric bursitis
# Right anterior lower leg pain
# Right sided varicose veins
Pt endorsed >4mths of pain in RLE that became acutely worse over 
the last few wks.  Her initial exam was most consistent with 
severe trochanteric bursitis on the right. She also has some 
focal pain along the right tibia which she felt was most 
consistent with pain from her varicose veins. The XRs of her 
tibia/fibula and right hip were without obvious pathology. There 
are no concerning neurologic symptoms to suggest a 
radiculopathy, no weakness or numbness though she may have some 
degree of chronic sciatica.  Mildly decreased patellar reflex on 
the right as compared to left may have been in the setting of 
pain and guarding; strength was normal bilaterally as was her 
sensation. 
She underwent U/S guided steroid injection of her trochanteric 
bursa w/ significant improvement in symptoms; ___ stated that 
there was some fluid near the bursa, suggestive of acute on 
chronic trochanteric bursitis. Her anterior shin pain improved 
with initiation of gabapentin and lidocaine patch in addition to 
her home tylenol and an increase in the frequency of her home 
tramadol (q8h PRN to q4h PRN).  Pt was not given her home 
hydromorphone PRN, though she did require one dose of 0.5 mg IV 
hydromorphone following her injection in the setting of an acute 
pain episode. She was discharged with Tramadol 50mg x15 tablets 
given increased requirement. By discharge, she was able ambulate 
and was felt safe for discharge home with a cane per ___ 
evaluation.  Pt was eager to leave and will reach out to her 
vascular surgeon for an appointment early in the new year for 
treatment of her painful varicose veins.

# Iron deficiency anemia:
Anemia is new since ___. Normocytic. Downtrended overnight to 
8.9 from 10.8. No concern for active bleeding. Per iron studies, 
she is iron deficient with a ferritin of 50. She endorses 
fatigue and restless leg syndrome. Etiology is unclear, though 
it may be related to the recent left breast hematoma of her 
breast (unlikely though the timing fits). Prior EGD with 
gastritis (___) for which she is on a BID PPI; prior 
colonoscopy ___ with findings that may be suggestive of 
celiac disease, though ttg at that time was normal with a normal 
IgA. She also had two polyps biopsied and were normal. On this 
admission, a vitamin D level was obtained to assess for evidence 
of malabsorption iso daily supplementation: level was 45. She 
was given ferric gluconate IV x1 on ___. TTG was repeated and 
pending at discharge. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===================
# History of DVT/PE on warfarin:
# Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome:
# Subtherapeutic INR:
Lupus anticoagulant positive in ___. She has been taking her 
home dose of warfarin (5 mg ___ and 7.5 mg other days). Her 
warfarin was held last ___ iso hematoma and she was not 
bridged with Lovenox upon reinitiation. INR on this admission 
was subtherapeutic at 1.4. Bridged during this hospitalization 
with Lovenox for goal INR ___. She was given an increased dose 
of warfarin, 7.5 mg daily while in house. INR at discharge was 
1.9, with plan to continue home warfarin regimen. Patient will 
get repeat INR on ___. 

# Vitamin D deficiency: pt takes 2,000 U vitamin D daily. Repeat 
level IS 45 which suggests against malabsorption to account for 
her iron deficiency. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
Code status: Full, presumed
HCP: ___, granddaughter - ___.

- Right trochanteric bursitis:
[] Consider repeat injection
[] Consider physical therapy

- Right anterior leg pain
[] discharged on gabapentin 600 mg three times daily

required Q4hrs during hospitalization. Will give two day supply 
of increased dose. Plan to see PCP next week.
[] Consider outpatient MRI of the lumbar spine for chronic pain 
[] Consider EMG
[] Vascular surgery follow up as outpt for treatment of painful 
veins

- Iron deficiency anemia:
[] Consider repeat IV iron infusion
[] F/u pending TTG
[] Consider further work up (though may be related to left 
breast hematoma)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___, 

You were admitted because you were having a lot of leg pain, 
making it difficult to walk. 

In the hospital, we gave you a steroid injection near your right 
thigh for a condition called, Trochanteric Bursitis. We also 
gave you a medication called Gabapentin to help with your leg 
pain lower down. 

We also started you on a medication called Lovenox in order to 
bridge you back to your warfarin - currently, your warfarin dose 
is 7.5 mg daily and your INR was 1.9 at discharge (goal ___. 

Finally, you received 1 dose of intravenous iron because you are 
iron deficient which may be why you are more fatigued than 
usual.

When you go home, please take your medications as prescribed and 
make an appointment with your primary care doctor. We do not 
know what exactly is causing the lower leg pain, so you may want 
to talk to your doctor about having an MRI of your spine. You 
can also ask your doctor about prescribing a medication called 
DICLOFENAC GEL, also called VOLTAREN. This is essentially Motrin 
or Advil in a topical form and may help your pain.

Additionally, please talk to your doctor about why you may be 
iron deficient. 

It was a pleasure taking part in your care. We wish you all the 
best with your health.

embolism (blood clot in the lungs). We treated this blood clot 
by giving you anti-coagulation medicine which you will continue 
to take as an outpatient. You should continue taking this 
medication until your primary care doctor (___) says it 
is okay to stop (likely ___ months). We spoke with your 
neurosurgeon (Dr. ___ who follows your aneurysm and he 
recommended that you get a repeat MRI of your brain while you 
were admitted. This MRI showed that the anuerysm has not changed 
in size since ___, it is still 4mm in size. We wish you all the 
___ in your continued recovery.

Sincerely,

Your ___ Team

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure providing care for you here at the ___ 
___.  You were admitted after having a syncopal 
(fainting) episode on ___.  You were found to have some 
evidence of a urinary tract infection and were treated with an 
antibiotic called Bactrim.  Your chest x-ray at the other 
hospital did not show evidence of a pneumonia.  We monitored 
your heart rhythm overnight and did not note any abnormalities.  
Your electrocardiogram did not show any changes.  Your blood 
pressure remained stable.  You will need an ultrasound of the 
heart for further evaluation (echocardiogram), but this can be 
done after you leave the ___. 

Your condition has improved and you can be discharged to home.

The following changes were made to your medications:

NEW: 
-Bactrim double-strength tab, 1 tab by mouth twice daily for 2 
more days (to treat urinary tract infection)

CHANGED:
- DECREASED Lisinopril to 10mg by mouth daily

Please keep your follow-up appointments as scheduled below.  We 
are also working to schedule your echocardiogram.

Of note, while you were here you had a video swallow study that 
did not show evidence that you are aspirating when you swallow.  
You can continue to eat a regular diet.

Blood Cultures: NGTD or negative in multiple cultures

Imaging:
CT Abd/Plevis with Contrast (___):
IMPRESSION:
1.  Diffuse colonic mucosal hyperenhancement and bowel wall 
thickening is
consistent with pancolitis.
2.  Ground-glass opacities within the right middle and right 
lower lobes
compatible with acute infection and/or aspiration.  Possible 
mild pulmonary
edema.
3.  Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and prominence of the 
common bile and pancreatic ducts could be better characterized 
with non-emergent MRCP.

CXR (___):
IMPRESSION:
1.  Bibasilar opacities would be consistent with pneumonia 
and/or aspiration in the right clinical setting.  Likely some 
component of pulmonary edema given the interstitial thickening.
2.  Multiple dilated loops of small bowel may represent ileus or 
obstruction. Dedicated abdominal radiograph may be performed for 
better characterization.

ECHO (___):
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Left ventricular 
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a mild 
resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe mitral annular 
calcification. There is moderate functional mitral stenosis 
(mean gradient XXmmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Mild 
to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to 
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be 
significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow 
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
mitral regurgitation is now less prominent. The mitral inflow 
gradient is similar (although not reported in the previous 
report). 

AXR (___):
There is no subdiaphragmatic free air.  There are multiple 
distended loops of bowel, most likely representing both colon 
and small bowel.  Findings are most consistent with an ileus.  
Air-fluid levels are seen on the left lateral decubitus view.
IMPRESSION:  Dilated colon and small bowel consistent with 
ileus.

Head CT (___): IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.

ECHO (___):
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is 
unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is 
hyperdynamic (EF 80%). Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. There is mild aortic valve stenosis 
(valve area 1.6 cm2). Due to the technically suboptimal nature 
of this study, LVOT obstruction cannot be excluded with 
certainty. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There 
is severe mitral annular calcification (cannot exclude posterior 
leaflet MVP). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due 
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may 
be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

Repeat CT Abd/Pelvis (___):
IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions, 
and in 
abdominal ascites.  The colon remains dilated and ahaustral, in 
keeping with C. difficile colitis. 

CXR (___):
There is a Dobbhoff tube whose distal tip is in the body of the 
stomach.  
There are bilateral pleural effusions.  There is a right-sided 
pleural-based catheter.  There is no pneumothoraces or signs for 
overt pulmonary edema.  Overall, these findings are stable since 
prior study from ___. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is an ___ year-old woman with history of Sjogren's syndrome 
and IBS presenting with fevers, diarrhea, tachycardia, 
hypotension, leukocytosis, hypoxia, found to have pancolitis and 
pneumonia.

# Septic Shock due to Cdiff Colitis: On admission meet criteria 
for sepsis given fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis and likely 
source being colitis. BP remained low and patient remained 
mildly tachycardic for next ___ requiring aggressive IVF 
(roughly 20L in first 72hrs). Initially started on IV flagyl/PO 
vanco emperically for possible Cdiff as well as levofloxacin 
over concern for PNA. Bcx, Ucx unrevealing. Stool for Cdiff 
ultimately positive and levofloxacin changed to CTX/Azithro. PCP 
(Dr. ___ visited and said that pt always has CXR infiltrate 
so abx for CTX/Azithro for pneumonia stopped after pt had 
received total of 3 days PNA treatment. Lactate and WBC count 
trended up in first 48hrs and patient developed ileus on 
abdominal imaging with worsening distension. GI and Gen Surg 
followed and pt kept NPO initially, but ultimately illness 
turned around with just Abx and IVF. By time of ICU call-out, BP 
had stabilized without requiring fluids and abdominal exam was 
improving with downtrending WBC. Came back to ICU on ___ due to 
respiratory distress and hypoxia. Also had to be started back on 
pressors, initially phenylephrine but then this was stopped as 
extremities were cold and mottled. Pressors changed to 
Norepinephrine and mottling of ext quickly resolved. SVO2 and 
ECHO not consistent with cardiogenic shock and EKG/Trops were 
negative. ID saw in consult and recommended starting Tigecycline 
to help cover Cdiff which she completed an 8 day course of. 
Abdominal exam improved and ileus resolved. Doboff was placed on 
___ and tube feeds were started due poor ability to keep with 
with nutritional requirements. Metronidazole d/c'd on ___. Plan 
to continue Vancomycin 500mg PO Q6 for a total of 2 weeks after 
all other antibiotics were stopped (last day ___.

# Hypoxia: No breathing issues at baseline but developed hypoxia 
requiring 5L NC while in ED so was admitted to the ICU. Initial 
concern for RLL PNA on CXR and received 3 days of Abx as noted 
above until PCP informed MICU team that infiltrate had been 
present for some time. Thought that hypoxia developed in setting 
of aggressive fluids in patient with significant mitral regurg 
(got 4L in ED and then aggressive IVF in first 72hrs) and the 
development of pleural effusions. Had started diuresis by MICU 
callout on ___ but then after couple days on floor, triggered 
for hypoxia and increased work of breathing on ___. Found to 
have significant worsening of R pleural effusion and development 
of L pleural effusion. Required intubation for respiratory state 
on ___. Cardiac w/u showed no cardiogenic component and when 
spiked fever on ___ started on empiric HCAP coverage after 
mini-BAL was performed. Interventional pulmonary (IP) consulted 
on ___ and performed right sided thoracentesis with pigtail 
placement. ID saw on ___ and recommended stopping 
Vanco/cefepime as unclear if actual pneumonia and starting 
Tigecycline as would cover many HCAP organisms and also treat 
Cdiff. Mini-BAL and pleural fluid with negative cultures. 
Started diuresis again on ___ as she was weaned off pressors 
and extubated. She was weaned off all oxygen at the time of 
discharge and right pigtail still draining 400-700cc per day, 
will follow-up with IP after discharge.  She will require 
ongoing diuresis given her significant volume overload, she 
responds well to ___ IV Lasix and had been ___ negative 
in the days leading up to discharge.

# Altered Mental Status: 
In setting of trigger for hypoxia and MICU transfer on ___, 
there was concern that she was less responsive with concern for 
focal defecits. Stat head CT without evidence of stroke or 
bleed. Neuro was consulted and said nothing to do and deficits 
resolved over next ___. EEG initially ordered but then 
canceled after discussion with neuro. Rest of ICU stay had 
intermittent delerium in the evenings requiring some doses of 
Olanzapine. Delerium had improved by time of ICU callout but 
still with some sundowning.

# Hyponatremia: Patient with Na of 127 in ED. Likely hypovolemic 
hyponatremia in setting of diarrhea/poor PO intake. Could also 
be SIADH given pneumonia, pain. Upon review of old labs, patient 
often hyponatremic as outpatient as well. Urine lytes confusing 
in setting of shock as urine Na elevated in ___ so some question 
of sodium wasting renal injury. Hyponatremia started to resolve 
as overall condition improved and did not re-develop even in 
setting of ___ ICU readmission for hypoxia.

# ___: Patient with creatinine of 1.1 at admission up from 
recent baseline of 0.7 - 0.8. Likely pre-renal etiology in 
setting of infection, diarrhea, poor PO intake. Trended up 
slightly to 1.3 after a few days likely with mild ATN in setting 
of persistent boarderline hypotension. Lisinopril was held while 
in ICU for this and hypotension. Cr trended back down to roughly 
0.5 and stayed there for rest of hospitalization even in setting 
of second ICU readmission.

--Inactive issues--

# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine 50 mcg daily

# Hypertension: Due to hypotension with sepsis, lisinopril was 
held.  BP remained well controlled and this will continue to be 
held at discharge.

# GERD: Omeprazole stopped when Cdiff came back positive. For 
time was put on H2 blocker for GI prophylaxis but this stopped 
again when delerious and started feeeding.

# Code: Full (confirmed with patient, son-in-law)

# Transitional issues
-Right pigtail pleural catheter in place at discharge, she will 
follow-up with interventional pulmonary after discharge. Tube 
can be removed when output is <200cc per day.
-Will need ongoing diuresis given large volume of fluids she 
received in the ICU this admission, she responds well to Lasix 
10mg IV. Goal ___ negative as BP tolerates.
-Will continue on high dose PO vancomycin through ___ (___fter other abx stopped)
-She should continue tube feeds until taking adequate PO, would 
benefit from ongoing nutrition evaluation

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman, recently hospitalized for C. Difficile sepsis 
and shock, re-admitted to ___ from ___ with altered 
mental status, tachypnea and a mild respiratory acidosis.

#Hypoxia/hypercarbia: She initially required BiPAP and was 
admitted to the MICU for monitoring of her respiratory status.  
She was able to be weaned from BiPAP on ICU day 2 and remained 
on 2L NC at the time of discharge.  Cause of her respiratory 
symptoms is unclear, but may be due to hypoventilation from 
somnolence related to oversedation with Zyprexa.  Zyprexa was 
held at the time of discharge.  CTA Chest was negative for PE 
and showed no clear evidence of pneumonia.  She was initially 
started on HCAP antibiotics with vanc/cefepime which were 
stopped on HD 4 prior to discharge given that all cultures were 
negative and there was no consolidation on imaging. 

# Delirium: Likely multifactorial, but thought to be related to 
oversedation from Zyprexa.  There was no evidence of infection 
and antibiotics were quickly stopped as described above.  UA was 
dirty, but UCx was negative x2 (grew only yeast) and she had no 
urinary symptoms.  Most of her mental status changes were 
probably related to her sedationg medications and hypercarbia at 
admission, which improved with BiPAP and holding her 
antipsychotics.

# C Diff Colitis: Recently admitted for C. diff colitis with 
sepsis. Repeat C Diff PCR was negative during this 
hospitalization. She continued to have high volume stool output 
and Flexiseal is in place for skin ulceration.  ID was curbsided 
regarding vanco course given that she received a few days of 
HCAP antibotics and her PO vanco was changed to 125mg q6h for 7 
days after stopping IV vanc/cefepime (D7 will be ___.  
Flexiseal in place at discharge.

# Anemia: Patient with guaiac positive stools this admission, 
new from past admission.  Felt to be secondary to sloughing and 
mucosal oozing secondary to C diff. Normal lactate on admission 
and benign abdominal exam.  Hct has been variable recently, but 
fairly stable, although still markedly below her baseline of low 
to mid ___.

# Bilateral pleural effusions: Noted to have bilateral pleural 
effusions last hospitalization in setting of massive fluid 
resuscitation, right pleural pigtail catheter removed this 
admission in the MICU. She is still volume overloaded on exam, 
but her bicarb remained elevated, and she was not given any 
further diuresis.  The elevated bicarb is also be partially due 
to compensation from her respiratory acidosis.

# Volume overload: She has some diastolic dysfunction and has 2+ 
MR on ___. She continues to appear total body overloaded, likely 
in setting of volume resuscitation on prior admission for 
sepsis, but with contraction alkalosis currently, so further 
diuresis was held as above.  Consider further diuresis once 
hypercarbia improves and bicarb trends down.  

# Hypothyroidism: Continued on levothyroxine 50 mcg daily 
 
# Hypertension: Patient was previously on lisinopril which was 
held since last admission in setting of sepsis and relative 
hypotension.  She remained normotensive

# GERD: Patient previously on omeprazole last hospitalization, 
which was stopped after C. diff came back positive, and she was 
transitioned to H2 blocker for GI prophylaxis but this was 
stopped again when she became delirious last hospitalization.  
She remains off H2 blocker at discharge because of concern that 
it may be contributing to her AMS.

# Code status this admission: FULL

# Transitional issues:
-Foley was removed ___ and she has not voided as of discharge, 
may need Foley replaced if she is unable to void
-Would restart diuresis when bicarb trends down
-Continue PO vanco 125mg q6h through ___
-Please follow Hct daily given melanotic stools, should resolve 
as her C. diff resolves
-Midline removed ___
-Pigtail catheter removed this admission
-F/u pending BCx, catheter tip cx

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST (___): There is no evidence of 
hemorrhage, edema, infarction, or mass effect. The ventricles 
and sulci are prominent, suggesting age-related involutional 
changes or atrophy. Periventricular white matter hypodensities 
are compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Basal 
cisterns appear patent, and there is preservation of gray-white 
matter differentiation. No fracture is identified. There is 
fluid within the nasal cavity, likely secondary to intubated 
state.  Atherosclerotic mural calcifications of the internal 
carotid arteries are present. The visualized paranasal sinuses, 
mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are otherwise clear. 
Bilateral ocular lenses have been replaced. IMPRESSION: No 
intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. 

TTE (___): The left atrium is normal ___ size. There is mild 
(non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. The 
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular 
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF = 75%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve 
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
severe mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity 
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] 
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is 
no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study dated ___ (images reviewed), 
findings are similar.  

AP UPRIGHT CHEST X-RAY (___): Compared to the most recent 
study, there is improvement ___ the mild pulmonary edema and 
decrease ___ the small left pleural effusion. Moderate right 
pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis are stable. 

AP UPRIGHT CHEST X-RAY (___): Cardiac size is normal. Lines 
and tubes are ___ the standard position. Large right and moderate 
left pleural effusions are grossly unchanged allowing the 
differences ___ positioning of the patient. Right upper lobe

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is an ___ year old woman, recently hospitalized for C. 
Difficile sepsis and shock, complicated by readmission 
hypoxia/hypercarbia (___) p/w hypercarbic respiratory 
failure and urinary tract infection. 
.
# Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Etiology likely 
multifactorial, primarily respiratory muscle weakness and pulm 
edema with pleural effusions as noted on admission x-ray (has 
history of 2+ mitral regurg). She remained intubated for most of 
her MICU stay due to pulmonary edema and respiratory muscle 
weakness with a poor negative inspiratory force (NIF). Her NIF 
gradually improved with optimization of her nutrition and 
supportive care. Her pulmonary edema was addressed with 
aggressive diuresis with IV and PO Lasix boluses (responds well 
to Lasix 10mg IV). With treatment of these issues, she was able 
to be successfully extubated to nasal cannula on ___. She 
was started on Lisinopril 5mg daily for afterload reduction ___ 
setting of her 2+ MR which may have been causing the pulmonary 
edema. She may require further PRN doses of Lasix at rehab; if 
so would try Lasix 20mg PO PRN. Consider increasing lisinopril 
to 10mg for better afterload reduction pressure tolerating.
.
# Pseudomonas UTI: Patient grew out Pseudomonas sensitive to 
everything but Gentamicin on ___ urine culture. She was 
initially started on double coverage with Cipro/Cefepime while 
cultures pending, then narrowed to Cefepime alone, then 
broadened to Meropenam per ID recs. There was concern that 
Meropenam caused a drug rash so she was then switched to IV 
Zosyn. She completed Zosyn course on ___, received total of 10 
days antibiotics for complicated UTI. 
.
# RASH: pt noted to have red macular rash on extremities after 
starting meropenam, initially presumed to be meropenam drug rash 
so meropenam was stopped. However this was later believed to be 
more consistent with contact dermatitis vs. eczema. 
Triamcinolone cream was started and rash improved. 
.
# C Diff Colitis: Patient was recently admitted for C. diff 
colitis with sepsis. Repeat C Diff PCR was negative during last 
hospitalization. She completed her PO vancomycin course on 
___. Her PO vancomycin was continued during hospitalization 
because of concurrent treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics 
(zosyn) for pseudomonas UTI. Her zosyn was completed on ___, 
should continued PO vanco until ___. 
.
# Anemia: Patient with guaiac positive stools during last 
admission, new from past admission. Hct stable ___ high ___ 
throughout hospitalization; she did receive one unit pRBC for 
colloid pressure support.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued on levothyroxine 50 mcg daily.
.
# GERD: Patient previously on omeprazole last hospitalization, 
which was stopped after C. diff came back positive, and she was 
transitioned to H2 blocker for GI prophylaxis which was held ___ 
setting of delirium. Famotidine was restarted at 20mg BID once 
she was no longer delirious. 

# EKG Changes: Patient had lateral STE and mildly elevated 
troponin x3 (CK/MB flat)on admission, felt likely due to blunt 
injury ___ compressions ___ ED vs. demand ischemia. 
.
# A-line: patient had femoral A-line placed ___ ED ___ setting of 
her hypotension. This was discontinued ___ ICU and replaced with 
PICC. She had one set of BCx which grew Lactobacillus, likely 
skin contaminant. Other surveillance cx negative. 
.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an ___ year old female with past medical history of 
sjogrens, hemorrhoids, prior cdiff infection, admitted ___ 
with bright red blood per rectum thought to be acute lower GI 
bleed, subsequently stabilizing without intervention, status 
post flexible sigmoidoscopy without identifiable source, 
remaining stable x greater than 4 days, able to be discharged to 
rehab facility.

# Acute GI Bleed NOS - Patient presented with acute episode of 
BRBPR concerning for lower GI source.  Patient subsequently 
monitored without new or worsening anemia.  After discussion 
with family and patient regarding whether or not to further 
workup, they opted for flexible sigmoidoscopy (felt colonoscopy 
might be too invasive).  Patient underwent aborted flexible 
sigmoidoscopy on ___ due to pressence of copious stool in 
rectal vault, and then underwent successful flexible 
sigmoidoscopy on ___ without identifiable source for her 
bleeding.  From admission Hgb 9.8, discharge hemoglobin was 
10.5.  Per GI, could consider outpatient colonoscopy if 
consistent with patient's wishes.  

# Osteoporosis / chronic L1 compression fracture / 
deconditioning - patient with recent L1 compression fracture as 
outpatient prior to admission; patient noted to be significantly 
deconditioned this admission, requiring assistance with ADLs; 
patient seen by ___ and recommended for rehab.  Continued home 
Calcium 500 + vitamin D, calcitonin.  Placed on Tylenol and 
tramadol for pain control with good effect 

# Chronic Severe Protein Calorie Malnutrition - per discussion 
with family and review of chart, patient has lost weight despite 
PEG placement and bolus tube feeds (has had difficulty 
maintaining PO intake due to her Sjogrens).  At home patient has 
not be using full recommended 2 cans of Nutren 2.0, 500 
Cal/250ml BID.  Here patient seen by nutrition, continued on 
above 2 cans, and was given oral supplementation with her PO 
meals as well.   

# Depression - continued home BuPROPion and mirtazapine 

# Hypothryoidism - continued levothyroxine 

Transitional Issues
- Code status - DNR/DNI
- Discharged to rehab
- No source for bleeding identified this admission; can consider 
future colonoscopy to look for source of bleeding, but would 
first discuss if consistent with patient's goals of care
- Would consider encouragement of PO intake and PEG-tube 
supplementation given her malnutrition

ECHO ___
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or 
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size 
are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the mid-anterior and mid-distal 
inferior wall. The estimated cardiac index is normal 
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Doppler parameters are indeterminate for left 
ventricular diastolic function. The right ventricular cavity is 
mildly dilated with depressed free wall contractility (RV free 
wall is not well seen). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are 
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular dysfunction c/w 
multivessel CAD, with overall mildly depressed global systolic 
function. Mildly dilated right ventricle with depressed free 
wall systolic function. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation with 
moderate pulmonary hypertension.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ year old gentleman with history of CAD 
(s/p CABG and PCI), pAF, PAH, diastolic CHF who presents with 
weight gain, leg swelling and new evidence of right ventricle 
dilation concerning for acute on chronic heart failure 
exacerbation.  

#Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure Exacerbation: with 
component of RV failure by report of OSH echo.  Likely primary 
process is lung disease causing elevated RV pressures and 
subsequent poor filling of LV.  He diuresed quite well with 20 
IV Lasix which is consistent with RV failure.  Started on 
torsemide 10 daily but this is likely too aggressive.  We 
obtained an echo but read PND at time of discharge.  We sent him 
home on a diuretic regimen on torsemide 5 mg daily (and 
discontinued home triamterene-HCTZ).  Close follow up with Dr. 
___ ensured.

#Elevated Transaminases:  Patient with mildly elevated AST and 
ALT. Most likely etiologies in this patient include amiodarone 
toxicity and congestive hepatopathy.  Encouraged outpatient 
trending. 

#Pulmonary disease: patient with extensive emphysema on CTA 
though patient has no history of smoking.  As this may be 
driving R heart failure, Dr. ___ requested pulmonology 
consult prior to discharge but patient was insistent on leaving. 
 Instead scheduled outpatient appointment. 
 
#Atrial Fibrillation: Continue home amiodarone 200mg daily,

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were hospitalized for progressive leg swelling over the past 
week and a half.  We started you on a new medication here that 
should help prevent this from happening.  Of note, Dr. ___ was 
concerned about a clot in your lungs, but our scans showed NO 
clot.  With this news, you were discharged home with PCP and 
cardiology follow up.

Please continue to take your torsemide in order to maintain your 
weight. Please weight yourself everyday and call your 
cardiologist if you weight changes by three pounds.

You also have ""pulmonary hypertension,"" which may be due to your 
underlying lung disease. Amiodarone can also cause lung changes 
and we recommend following up with the lung doctors as ___ 
outpatient to see if this may be contributing. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you!
Your ___ team

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea on Exertion
HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with a past medical
history pertinent for HFrEF (35% ___ CAD s/p CABG and
subsequent PCI, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, right
ventricular dysfunction, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on apixaban, stage III chronic
kidney disease (Baseline Cr 2.0-2.1), cerebrovascular disease,
and metastatic melanoma of unknown primary on checkpoint
inhibitor pembrolizumab who was found volume overloaded with
increased DOE, admitted to ___ for IV diuresis. 

Per most recent outpatient CHF notes:

He was seen by his primary car primary Cardiologist, Dr. ___ increased fatigue and exertional dyspnea. Dr. ___ 
a
___ and felt his LVEF was ~30% and reduced from prior. He was
started on low-dose Entresto, but couldn't tolerate it from a BP
prospective. He was previously on losartan which was stopped
due to this lightheadedness, dizziness and worsening renal
function. Dr. ___ concern about the possibility of
myocarditis secondary to the checkpoint inhibitor. When he
followed up with the Oncology team on ___, his symptoms were
somewhat improved. Cardiac biomarkers were notable for a rising
NTproBNP to >10K but normal CK-MB and minimally elevated 
troponin
T of 0.03, which is not unexpected in the setting
of decompensated ___ failure and chronic kidney disease. He 
was
planned to receive immunotherapy on ___, but treatment was
held due to elevated Cr. Recheck showed improvement. The patient
restarted pembrolizumab on ___. Pembrolizumab was again 
held
in ___ for diarrhea and elevated LFTs 

In addition, he also received intravenous hydration.
Subsequently, he was noted to be more volume overloaded, at 
which
time Torsemide from 20 mg daily to 30 mg daily then 40 mg daily.
Troponin testing showed Trop-T of 0.04, attributed to renal
insufficiency. The patient was also noted to have mild
hyperkalemia (K 5.7) for which potassium supplementation was
stopped and torsemide dose increased. He was also seen in the
Emergency room in the ___ ___ due to a
fall with resultant scalp laceration. CT head and neck was
unremarkable. 

He presented this morning ___ for his scheduled visit at
___ clinic where he noted that his weight had been 126 lbs most
recently on his home scale. He also reported decreased appetite
that he attributes to eating a different diet. He currently has 
a
___ care taker that makes ___ food for him, adhering
to a low sodium diet, that he does not like as much as his
regular diet. He drinks ___ glasses of water or juice daily. He
was taking torsemide 40 mg daily, that he decreased to 30 mg
daily several days ago as he felt he was urinating too
frequently. He also ran out of tamsulosin several days ago so
stopped taking this around the same time. He noted becoming 
short
of breath after taking 20 steps or less. Due to his volume
overloaded noted on exam he was recommended for admission to ___
for IV diuresis

On the floor, he endorses the above history. He noted that his
SOB has progressive gotten worse. Mostly occurs with activity.
None at rest. He noted that his weight has been slowly 
decreasing
due lack of appetite and him being to lazy. He has a home health
aid everyday from 11am-7pm, who helps him with ADL.  He endorses
abdominal bloading. 

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope,
or presyncope.

ROS otherwise negative, unless otherwise noted above

PATIENT SUMMARY: 
==================== 
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with PMHx of CAD s/p 
CABG
and subsequent PCI, HFrEF (35% ___, moderate tricuspid
regurgitation, right ventricular dysfunction, moderate pulmonary
hypertension, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on apixaban,
stage III chronic kidney disease (Baseline Cr 2.0-2.1),
cerebrovascular disease, and metastatic melanoma of unknown
primary on checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab who was found
volume overloaded with increased DOE, admitted to acute ___ 
failure for IV diuresis, now transitioned to oral duiretics. 

# CORONARIES: Left Main and two vessel coronary disease (___).
# PUMP: 35% ___ 
# RHYTHM: Ectopic rhythm, PR prolongation, left axis deviation, 
RBBB

ACTIVE ISSUES: 
============== 
# ___ Failure with reduced ejection fraction
# Right ventricular dysfunction, TR, pulm HTN
# Volume overload
His ___ failure exacerbation is likely secondary to his recent
administration of IV fluids in addition to his self down
titration of his torsemide over the last week. In addition, he
does not follow a restricted fluid intake and drinks ___ glasses
of water or juice daily. Furthermore, he has not tolerated
guideline directed medical therapy due to recurrent issues with
acute kidney injury and elevated transaminitis while on
pembrolizumab therapy. He was clinically volume overloaded with
elevated BNP 16020. We initiated IV lasix 160 bolus and put him 
on a lasix gtt with good response, however he his Cr increased 
from 2.1-->2.7. His Cr. improved with transition to PO Torsemide 
40 mg daily. We monitored and aggressively repleted his 
potassium. No afterload reduction or neural hormonal blockade 
was added.

# Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline 2.1-2.3 . 
Cr 2.1 on admission(Stable )- Cr on discharge:2.2
Cr initially uptrended above baseline from 2.1---> 2.7. Felt 
likely due to increased diuretic usage as it improved with 
stopping diuretics. Less likely cardiorenal syndrome. In 
addition,patient was recently seen in follow-up by nephrology. 
They felt his CKD was less likely to be related to pembrolizumab 
and more likely related to age-related decline in renal 
function. Creatinine 2.2 on discharge (stable).

# Metastatic Melanoma 
He is followed by Dr. ___. He was previously on
Pembrolizumab which was held due diarrhea, elevated LFTs and
worsening kidney function. Negative troponin and CK MB, no 
concern
for drug-induced myocarditis at this point. Followup in 
___ clinic in 2weeks after discharge

# Elevated transaminiatis
Stable. Statin and ___ had previously been held. No changes made 
during admission. 

# Urinary frequency
Likely due to diuretic use. Afebrile and asx otherwise
-Continued home tamsulosin

# Coronary artery disease, s/p CABG and LAD PCI.
-Continued aspirin 81 mg daily
-Statin stopped prior to admission due to elevated LFTs. 
Continued holding. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
============== 

# Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation
Rythym: Continue amiodarone 200mg for rhythm control strategy
(monitoring safety labs)
-Continued anticoagulation with apixaban 2.5mg twice daily

# Hypertension: Stable.

[] Consider starting spironolactone and ___ pending blood 
pressures; trialed losartan and spironolactone during this 
admission, but ultimately held due to hypotension. 
[] His LFTs should be rechecked ~2 weeks after discharge 
(___). He has a history of transaminitis attributed in part 
to statin use in the past; he was restarted on rosuvastatin this 
admission (given history of CAD s/p CABG), and LFTs on day of 
admission were ALT 38, AST 46, Alk phos 108, Tbili 0.5.
[] Follow up with Oncology regarding melanoma.
[] Monitor for resolution of supplemental O2 requirement after 
discharge. He was requiring ___ of O2 by NC at time of 
discharge, in the setting of recovering from pneumonia.

DISCHARGE WT: 116.18 lbs
DISCHARTE Cr: 2.0
DISCHARGE DIURETIC: torsemide 60 mg PO BID

SUMMARY:
===============
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with PMH of HFrEF (35% 
___,
CAD s/p 3v CABG (___) and subsequent PCI to the LAD (___),
moderate tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular dysfunction,
moderate pulmonary hypertension, and paroxysmal atrial 
fibrillation on apixaban, stage III chronic kidney disease 
(Baseline Cr 2.0-2.1), cerebrovascular disease, and metastatic 
melanoma of unknown primary on Pembrolizumab (on hold since 
___ iso worsening transaminitis and concern for 
cardiotoxicity). He was admitted with volume overload from heart 
failure exacerbation and pneumonia with high oxygen 
requirements. He initially required CCU admission for high flow 
oxygen, weaned to nasal cannula after aggressive IV diuresis and 
treatment of pneumonia with 5 day course of Zosyn after 
receiving vancomycin at OSH. He was transferred to cardiology 
floor where he continued to diurese well and his oxygen 
requirement was weaned to ___. He was transitioned to 60 mg 
torsemide PO BID which adequately maintained euvolemia. 

ACUTE ISSUES: 
============= 
# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation
Patient with history of heart failure with etiology likely 
ischemic cardiomyopathy given history of CAD s/p CABG and PCI. 
Admitted with fluid overload and pleural effusion. Trigger for 
current exacerbation could be infectious given evidence of 
pneumonia in left lower lobe on admission. Patient with high 
oxygen requirements prior to admission but responded 
appropriately to diuresis with Lasix. After IV diuresis, patient 
was transitioned PO torsemide and maintained at euvolemia. With 
effective diuresis, the patient's oxygen requirement gradually 
lowered from 4L NC to ___ NC. He was discharged on torsemide 60 
mg PO BID. He was unable to tolerate afterload reducing agents 
or neurohormonal blockade agents due to hypotension. 

# Lower left lobe pneumonia
Patient with evidence of pneumonia in the left lower lobe, 
received vanc/zosyn at outside hospital and continued on Zosyn 
here for a total of 5 day course with resolution of symptoms. We 
suspect that his lingering O2 requirement is at least in part 
due to slowly resorbing consolidation left over from his 
infection. He was requiring ___ of supplemental O2 by NC at 
time of discharge.

# Pleural effusion, bilateral
Patient with evidence of right pleural effusion. Etiology likely 
fluid overload given heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction. Pleural effusion resolved improved with diuresis and 
his oxygen requirement trended down to ___ NC. Given this, 
thoracentesis was deferred. 

# Atrial fibrillation
Patient with chronic history of atrial fibrillation. In afib 
throughout this admission. Continued amiodarone and apixaban. 
Rates appropriately controlled.

CHRONIC ISSUES
================
# Coronary artery disease s/p CABG
Patient with history of 3 vessel CABG on ___ (___) and
subsequent PCI to LAD (___). Continued home aspirin. Patient 
was started on low dose rosuvastatin 5 mg daily. On review, it 
appears he had been on this medication at this dose in the past 
but it was discontinued due to transamnitis; however, at the 
time it was unclear whether this was an effect of the statin or 
pembrolizumab. Given that the patient has not had his checkpoint 
inhibitor therapy since ___, the decision was to restart 
rosuvastatin.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___. 

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==========================   
- You were admitted because of you were short of breath 

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==============================  
- You were found to have fluid on your lungs. This was because 
you have a medical condition called heart failure, where your 
heart does not pump hard enough and fluid backs up into your 
lungs. 
- You were given a diuretic medication to help get the fluid 
out. You improved considerably and are ready to leave the 
hospital.  

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
================================  
- Be sure to take all your medications and attend all of your 
appointments listed below. 
- Your weight at discharge is 116.18 lbs. Please weigh yourself 
today at home and use this as your new baseline  
- Please weigh yourself every day in the morning. Call your 
doctor or the HeartLine at ___ if your weight goes up 
by more than 3 lbs or you experience significant chest pain and 
shortness of breath.  

Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best!  

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team

History of Present Illness:
 HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: Mr. ___ is a ___
male with rheumatoid arthritis, DMARD holiday, and recent, brief
hospitalization for presumptive pericarditis, returned to 
outside
hospital with probable cardiac tamponade now post-bedside
pericardiocentesis with drain placement prior to transfer.
Importantly, patient was hospitalized at ___ on ___ with acute pleuritic chest pain of two-day duration in the
context of constellation of fatigue, malaise, upper respiratory
symptoms, and non-productive cough. While CTA exonerated
pulmonary embolism, thickened pericardium and small effusion 
were
noted, suggesting pericarditis. ECG revealed subtle diffuse ST
elevations in keeping with pericarditis. Echocardiogram 
confirmed
said effusion, though no features of tamponade were appreciated.
He was discharged the same day with ibuprofen 600 mg TID and
colchicine 0.6 mg BID. He had persistence of minor residual 
chest
pain, which began to worsen two days later, but was tolerable
until yesterday evening when it evolved to severe, unrelenting
pain across his precordium likened to ""wearing shoulder pads
bearing down on him."" He notes a new concurrent substernal chest
pain that ""goes straight to his back."" He then became dyspneic,
prompting him to seek care. He arrived at ___ hypotensive
with SBP in the 80-range. He was borderline tachycardic and in
mild respiratory distress, but oxygenation was acceptable. He
rapidly received three liters of fluid for presumptive tamponade
within the confines of poor windows on bedside echocardiogram.
Pericardiocentesis yielded 400 cc or more of serous fluid and a
pericardial drain was placed. Hemodynamics rapidly improved. On
arrival to ___ ED, patient was indeed hemodynamically stable
but was then in moderate respiratory distress, requiring
non-rebreather. He was given Lasix 20 mg IV. Bedside
echocardiogram was limited, but preliminarily suggestive of 
small
residual effusion. In the CCU, patient notes resurgence of said
chest pain. His dyspnea is improving. An additional 250 cc was
drained.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY: 
===================== 
___ male with rheumatoid arthritis, DMARD holiday, and
recent, brief hospitalization for presumptive pericarditis,
returned to outside hospital with pericardial effusion with 
possible tamponade physiology now post-bedside 
pericardiocentesis prior to transfer, with persistent 
pericardial effusion now s/p drain placement with course 
complicated by acute hypercapneic respiratory distress. 

#CORONARIES: unknown.
#PUMP: normal biventricular structure and function. 
#RHYTHM: NSR. pAF ___

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] He was discharged on ibuprofen 600mg TID and colchicine 0.6mg 
BID for his inflammatory pericarditis. He should continue 
colchicine for 3 months. He should have his ibuprofen tapered 
weekly following resolution of his symptoms over 3 weeks to 
reduce the risk of recurrence. 
[] He was discharged on a PPI and should continue this while on 
ibuprofen. 
[] Strongly recommend that patient receive outpatient PFTs given 
high suspicion for baseline obstructive/restrictive pulmonary 
disease 
[] Patient developed paroxysmal afib with RVR during this 
admission which is a new diagnosis. CHADSVASC 2 for hypertension 
and diabetes. Anticoagulation was not started during this 
admission given that he was felt to have relatively low risk for 
CVA, however please make a note of this new diagnosis and 
reassess need for anticoagulation as medically appropriate. 
[] He was newly diagnosed with DM (HbA1c 7.9 at ___ 
and will be discharged on metformin 500 BID. Will require 
outpatient follow-up for this and can consider uptitration in 
the outpatient setting. 
[] Please reassess need for diuretic in the outpatient setting. 
He had no echocardiographic evidence of heart failure during 
this admission so was not discharged on diuretics. 

New medications:
Metformin 500mg BID
Metoprolol XL 50mg QD 
Omeprazole 20mg QD 

Continued medications:
Atorvastatin 10mg QPM
Colchicine 0.6mg BID
Ibuprofen 600mg TID
Folic acid 1mg PO QD
Sertraline 100mg PO QD

Stopped medications: 
Methotrexate 20mg PO
Famotidine 20mg QD

ACUTE ISSUES: 
=============
#) Acute pericarditis
#) Cardiac tamponade, now s/p pericardiocentesis and drain
placement 
He presented with inflammatory pericarditis of probable viral 
nature in the context of viral-like prodrome versus rheumatic 
pericarditis, given serologic positive active disease in the 
absence of DMARD. Pericardial fluid cultures from ___ 
negative, cultures here with 1 colony on 1 plate of coag 
negative staph felt to be contaminant, negative acid fast smear. 
No biochemical evidence of myocardial injury on admission, 
unlikely to have concurrent myocarditis or cardiac event 
sequelae. At ___ was initially noted to have SBPs in 
the ___ and received fluid resuscitation and pericardiocentesis 
given concern for tamponade physiology. Hemodynamics 
subsequently stabilized and remained so throughout the duration 
of his admission here. TTE on ___ showed no pericardial 
effusion. Pericardial drain was initially left to gravity due to 
continued output, and was removed ___. He was treated with 
colchicine 0.6mg BID which he will continue for 3 months after 
discharge. He also received ibuprofen 600mg PO TID and will be 
discharged on a slow taper; he received PPI while receiving 
NSAIDs. 

#) Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure - resolving
Probable flash pulmonary edema from rapid large-volume fluid 
administration on tamponade, as evidenced by radiographic 
pulmonary edema. Earlier echocardiogram otherwise not suggestive 
of ventricular dysfunction and BNP is within normal limits. TTE 
on ___ was without evidence of cardiac etiology for his 
pulmonary edema/respiratory failure.
Patient likely has unappreciated restrictive pulmonary 
physiology. Additionally, no emphysematous changes noted on CT 
one week ago, but
background obstructive defect is conceivable, given compelling
smoking history. He had a negative CTA one week prior to 
admission. Patient had leukocytosis on admission without clear 
radiographic consolidation suggestive of pneumonia - one dose of 
empiric azithromycin was given overnight and discontinued on 
___. He received IV diuresis with significant improvement in 
his respiratory status. O2 weaned ___ morning. He was breathing 
comfortably on RA at the time of discharge with ambulatory 
saturations >90%. 

#) Paroxysmal AFib, new diagnosis 
Patient went into Afib with RVR on ___, and subsequently 
received metoprolol. He subsequently flipped back into NSR. His 
CHADsVASC = 2 (DM, HTN). Anticoagulation was discussed but 
ultimately deferred at the time of discharge given the patient's 
lower overall risk for CVA and concerns regarding medication 
adherence/cost. He was discharged on metoprolol. He should have 
his need for anticoagulation reassessed as an outpatient as 
medically appropriate. 

#) Type II diabetes: 
He was newly diagnosed with DM with a A1C of 7.9% during this 
admission. He was maintained on an insulin sliding scale during 
this admission and will be discharged on metformin 500mg BID. 

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
====================
#) Rheumatoid arthritis: 
RF and anti-CCP positive per outpatient rheumatology. Not
currently endorsing sx suggestive of RA flare. Per discussion
with OP rheumatologist, deferred restarting MTX and/or other
DMARD until outpatient.

#) HTN
His home BP meds were held initially due to soft BPs and were 
stopped at the time of discharge as he remained normotensive.

Relevant Imaging:
-----------------
TTE ___:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and 
cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= ? 35-40% - assessment 
limited by suboptimal image quality and significant beat to beat 
variability). There is hypokinesis of the mid-distal LV segments 
and apex. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve 
leaflets cannot be determined. There is mild aortic valve 
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial 
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior focused study (images reviewed) of 
___, left ventricular systolic function is probably 
similar, although suboptimal image quality of both studies 
precludes definite comparison.  

___ CXR
 
IMPRESSION:  
  
Generalized improvement in both lungs is probably due to 
decrease in pulmonary 
edema, now mild, and decrease in previous moderate right pleural 
effusion.  
There is still substantial consolidation in the right upper lobe 
probably 
pneumonia but the bilateral lower lobe components have improved. 
 Heart size 
top-normal.  No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ M w/ HTN, HLD, DMII, and old MI transferred 
from ___ w/ NSTEMI w/ diffuse 3 vessel disease s/p DES to 
mid-LAD occlusion found to have severe Cdiff.

ACTIVE ISSUES
==============
# NSTEMI 
NSTEMI based on STE aVR and V1 but o/w ST depressions w/ 
significant multi vessel disease but significant stenosis in LAD 
s/p DES that occluded diagnonal. Repeat cath unchanged. He was 
started on plavix, atorvastatin, ACE-I, and metoprolol. Echo 
showed LVEF 35-40% with hypokinesis of mid-distal LV segments 
and apex. He was started on warfarin for his hypokinetic LV as 
well as his atrial fibrillation as discussed below.

# ___
Possibly mixed cardiogenic/distributive given mixed venous O2 
65%, CI 2.1, PCWP 25. He initially required pressors and balloon 
pump and was then successfully weaned off both. He remained 
hemodynamically stable during rest of hospital course. 

# Atrial Fibrillation
Patient with a reported history of paroxysmal afib per his PCP 
for which he was maintained on digoxin as well as aspirin 325mg 
PO daily prior to admission.  He was found to be in atrial 
fibrillation during admission and the decision was made to 
anticoagulate with Coumadin.  He was continued on home dose 
digoxin.  His home dose aspirin was decreased as discussed above 
with initiation of Coumadin.

# Hematuria: 
Likely traumatic in setting of systemic anticoagulation, as 
patient pulled at ___. Cytology was negative. He will followup 
outpatient with urology.

# Dyspnea: 
Patient had acute episodes of dyspnea.  This was mainly 
attributed to pulmonary edema and improved with diruesis.  
Additionally, CXR showed possible consolidation of RUL, 
concerning for aspiration pneumonia. However, treatment was 
deferred as he had no other focal signs of infectious pna.  He 
did have sputum cultures which grew Klebsiella pneumonia but on 
discussion with ID, felt this did not warrant any treatment as 
he was asymptomatic.  He was discharged on po lasix 20 mg daily 
with next electrolytes to be checked ___. 
 
# C diff, severe: 
Had loose stool in setting of antibiotic tx for Hpylori 
(initiated outpatient). Given WBC >15, ___, age >___ treated as 
severe. Patient was started on vancomycin 125mg PO qid for 14 
day course (day ___, last day ___. 
 
# GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD): 
Endoscopy confirmed H Pylori treated with PPI + 
clarithromycin/amoxicillin since ___ for 14 days. Omeprazole 
was continued. Antibiotics held in setting of c.diff infection. 

# Delirium: 
Patient with frequent sundowning during hospitalization 
requiring Seroquel po.

CHRONIC ISSUES
===============
# Spinal Stenosis: Continued gabapentin, d/ced naproxen.  Did 
not complain of pain throughout hospital course.  Explained he 
should not take any more NSAIDS in setting of recent ACS and now 
on Coumadin, Plavix and asa. 
# DM: maintained on ISS during admission and discharged on home 
glipizide and metformin
# HTN: Home dose metoprolol uptitrated.  Home dose lisinopril 
decreased.  Home dose imdur discontinued.
# HLD: Transitioned home dose simvastatin to atorvastatin

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=====================
- Discharge weight: 63.7kg 
- patient will require urology followup given hematuria during 
admission.  Urine cytology negative.
- patient will need to be treated for hpylori once he completes 
a course of PO Vancomycin for Severe CDiff
- Please check electrolytes on ___ on lasix
- Coumadin initiated given atrial fibrillation, ASA decreased 
from 325 mg to 81 mg daily
- Started on Plavix given recent stent placement, atorvastatin 
80 mg (stopped simvastatin), and Lasix 20 mg po daily
- Home metoprolol was increased from 25 mg XL to 50 mg XL daily, 
lisinopril decreased to 2.5 mg po daily and home imdur was 
discontinued
- patient will need to continue a 14 day course of PO Vanc (day 
___- ___ last day ___ for cdiff infection
- Patient instructed to not take any NSAIDS
- SLP treatment at rehab for pharyngeal strengthening exercises

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL SUMMARY:
=======================
___ female with history of disordered eating, PTSD, GAD 
with panic disorder, depression and functional neurological 
disorder presenting from a therapy session with weakness, 
abnormal movement, and aphasia concerning for an acute 
functional neurological episode. She was evaluated by neurology 
and psychology who felt this was consistent with functional 
neurological disorder, similar to her prior presentation. She 
began working with ___ and OT and had made great improvement at 
time of discharge to acute rehab. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
For rehab:
[] Please continue aggressive ___ and OT for further improvement 
in functional status. 
[] On discharge, please ensure patient has follow up with her 
PCP and her therapist. 
[] Patient was having some intermittent nausea as appetite 
improved. Please continue Zofran TID prn. QTc was 441 on EKG on 
___. If continuing Zofran use for >1 week, please recheck QTc 
on ___ and d/c medication if prolonged.
[] Patient has a history of disordered and restrictive eating. 
She does well eating with encouragement and did not show any 
evidence of eating disorder while inpatient. Please continue 
ensure supplements TID with meals. 

For PCP/therapist:
[] Please refer patient to psychiatrist for further titration of 
psychiatric medications, given report of previous sensitivity to 
medications and concern for possible bipolar disorder diagnosis. 

[] Please follow up pending thiamine level. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
# GAD/Panic disorder
# Depression
# PTSD
# Functional neurological disorder
Patient presented from a therapy session where she had acute 
onset of weakness, abnormal movement and aphasia in the setting 
of potential trigger of seeing shadows outside the door. Per her 
therapist, over the past several weeks she has been increasingly 
more hypervigilant and stressed about going home for the 
holidays to see her mom, which is a major trigger for her PTSD. 
Her therapist also reports a history of sexual/physical/verbal 
abuse but patient is very guarded about it and will not discuss 
it. On presentation to the ___ had significant and acute 
functional neurological symptoms, including weakness, abnormal 
movement, and aphasia, resulting in impaired functioning. There 
was concern for catatonia and she improved after 1 mg IV ativan 
in the ER. She endorsed significant anxiety, but denied SI and, 
per Psychiatry, she did not meet ___ criteria. She had a 
similar episode in ___ after IV iron infusion and was 
admitted to the neurology service, where she was diagnosed with 
functional neurological disorder and she improved with ___ and 
rehab. She was also started on nortriptyline 10 mg QHS at that 
time. Per her therapist, she is sensitive to medications and 
when she was on SSRIs she became manic, although she has not 
formally been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Once admitted, 
she was re-evaluated by neuro and psychiatry who determined this 
was not consistent with catatonia and instead was likely 
functional neurological disorder. She was recommended for acute 
rehab to continue aggressive ___. She was continued on home 
nortriptyline 10mg qhs.

History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: Mr ___ is a ___ year old male 
with one week of acute onset abdominal pain. He describes the 
pain as colicy and it lasts seconds. The pain began one week 
ago. He reports chills and cold sweats. He denies any subjetive 
fevers. He decided to go to the ED on ___ morning for 
further evaluation. In the ED they performed a CT exam and found 
isolated elevated liver enzymes. The CT showed mildly dilated 
and fluid-filled loops of jejunum that could be seen with a 
focal ileus which may reflect a mild inflammatory process such 
as gastroenteritis. He was discharged home.  
.
On ___ night he again had an episode of severe pain that 
woke him up at night and came to the ED again for evaluation. In 
the ED they performed a KUB which showed air-fluid levels which 
are non-specific without evidence for bowel dilatation; 
obstruction was not entirely excluded however. They also 
performed an ultrasound of the liver which showed no evidence of 
acute cholecystitis. The exam also showed fatty infiltration of 
the liver, although other forms of more advanced liver disease, 
including cirrhosis, could not be excluded. 
. 
Since his admission on ___, he has not had a bowel 
movement. He reporets that prior to two days ago his stool was 
normal without melena or blood. He denies any diarrhea or 
constipation. He also has been unable to eat for the past two 
days. He says he has lost his appetite. He says his lack of 
appetite is not secondary to nausea or abdominal pain. The 
patient says he occasionally has nausea and feels like vomiting, 
but has not vomited since his pain began one week ago. The pain 
returned again last night and he decided to come to the ED for 
IV antibiotics. 
. 
Of note he has been diagnosed with H. pylori in the past but did 
not complete a full treatment course. 
.  
Initial VS in the ED: 96.4 66 165/110 18 100% 
.
Patient was given 2L NS and morphine 2mg and required oxygen for 
desaturation to 91% afterward. He was admitted for futher 
workup. 
.  
Review of systems:  
(+) Per HPI  
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or 
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or 
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain 
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or 
bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Elevated LFTs: CT, KUB and RUQ US did not show evidence of 
acute cholecystetis, despite the positive ___ sign. It is 
possible the patient has underlying viral hepatitis, the 
serologies were sent in the ED. We are reassured by downtrending 
LFTs. Iron studies were within normal limits making 
hemochromotosis less likely. The patient felt significant relief 
with his bowel movement, and therefore it is likely he had a 
degree of constipation contributing to his presentation. 
Troponins were negative and EKG was unremarkable making a 
cardiac etiology unlikely. He tolerated food well and his pain 
was significantly improved with minimal need for oxycodone. 
.  
# GERD/H. pylori: Patient has known history of GERD and is 
treated with prilosec with relief of symptoms. He also has a 
history of untreated H. pylory diagnosed in ___. The 
patient was given perscriptions at that time by his PCP but he 
never filled the perscriptions. We started treatment for 
presumed H. pylori with omeprazole 20mg BID, amoxicillin 1g BID 
and clarithromycin 500mg BID for ten days 
.  
# Anxiety: Patient takes sertraline 75mg daily, we will continue 
in house. 
.
# Transition issues: Hepatitis serologies were pending at time 
of discharge. The patient also had stool studies which were 
pending. His LFTs have been trending downward, but he will need 
repeat LFTs once he follows up with his PCP.

and CT scan did show fatty liver.  Some of your blood tests were 
not back yet and we recommend that you discuss these results 
with your primary care doctor and get repeat liver tests next 
week. Overall we were feel that you are safe to go home. 

Because you are experiencing constipation which can also 
contribute to your abdominal pain, we will send you home with 
some medications that will help you have regular bowel 
movements.

DISCHARGE LABS:
===========================

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o ___ homeless F with PMHx of TBI, HIV+, HCV, 
polysubstance abuse (alcohol, crack cocaine, and heroin), 
unspecified mood disorder (MDD with psychotic features vs. 
substance-induced mood disorder), and chronic AH who presented 
from ___ station via EMS with complaint of multiple head strikes 
found to have EtOH intoxication and SI admitted to MICU for EtOH 
withdrawal and CIWA monitoring, now stabilized and transferred 
to the floor, now medically stable for discharge to psychiatric 
facility

ACTIVE ISSUES:
========================
# EtOH intoxication/withdrawal: on phenobarbital withdrawal 
protocol.  Last drink ___.  Patient was loaded with 
phenobarbital, which may continue if the accepting psychiatric 
facility is okay with administering, however there is no 
contraindication to discontinuing.
-Phenobarb protocol while inpatient, stopped at discharge
-Continued MVI, thiamine, folate
-Hydroxyzine PRN for additional agitation
-seen by psychiatry and social work - appreciated.

# Suicidal ideation: patient repeatedly stating ""I have suicidal 
thoughts"" and ""I'm depressed,"" though is unable to fully 
elaborate. Psychiatry saw the patient and had the following 
recommendations: -Patient meets ___ criteria for 
involuntary admission, may not leave AMA, should continue 1:1 
observation.
-Would hold on any psychiatric medications given acute alcohol 
withdrawal.
-If chemical restraint necessary, please call psychiatry for 
specific recs. Please be aware that patient has cited ""jaw 
locking"" with Haldol administration in the past, thus would 
consider alternative antipsychotic.
- seen by psychiatry - recommended inpatient psychiatric 
placement, and transferred to deac 4.

# FEVER: Patient febrile to 101 in the ED. No localizing signs 
of symptoms of infection. Suspect that this was likely related 
to acute ingestion, however given her murmur which has not been 
documented previously,  obtained TTE which showed no evidence of 
vegetation or endocarditis.

# Psychosis: suspect this is part of underlying psych disorder 
and not necessarily alcoholic hallucinosis.  Will defer to 
psychiatry.
-Appreciate Psychiatry recs

CHRONIC STABLE ISSUES:
========================
# HIV: not on HAART, started Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis given 
last CD4 count was <200, will send repeat CD4 count on ___ if 
still inpatient.  Patient was previously not taking her HAART 
medications, will defer to outpatient.

# HCV: not on active treatment
- Monitor LFTs, as above

Transitioanl issues:
Should see PCP re HIV and HCV once psychiatrically stabilized.

History of Present Illness:
___ y.o male with past medical history significant for DM, remote 
heart attack who presents with acute onset shoulder pain of 5 
days duration. The pain became worse the day after onset, and he 
presented to the emergency room where he was ruled out for a 
myocardial infarction. Aspiration of the joint yielded no fluid. 
The patient went to his primary care provider who referred him 
to orthopedics, where he was ordered an MRI. His MRI the day 
prior to admission showed diffuse edema of his deltoid and 
trapezius muscles. The patient finds that any sort of movement 
causes the pain to be much worse. He took some motrin and 
percocet at home which provided some relief ___ -> ___ pain.  

  
Of note, the patient reports that several months ago he had what 
was a presumed gout attack in his hands that his son, an ER 
physician prescribed him prednisone. This entirely resolved his 
symptoms, but a definitive diagnosis was never made. He denies 
any recent upper respiratory symptoms, fevers, chills, or other 
symptoms at home. He has not had any recent medication changes. 
He has no history of trauma or abnormal movement of his shoulder 
and cannot remember any injury to that area.  
In the ED, initial VS were 98 69 88/54 18 100%; The patient 
received morphine and percocet with mild improvement of his 
pain. His creatinine was also found to be elevated at 2.1 from 4 
days prior.

IMAGING
MRI SHOULDER ___
IMPRESSION: Trace fluid in the acromioclavicular joint with 
minimal 
irregularity of the articular surfaces and large amount of edema 
in the 
trapezius and deltoid muscles. The spectrum of findings could be 
seen in the setting of acute injury as in a grade 1 sprain of 
the acromioclavicular joint. 
However, given the absence of any history of trauma the findings 
are 
consistent with nonspecific myositis of the trapezius and 
deltoid muscles.  Given the trace amount of fluid in the 
acromioclavicular joint superimposed infection in this region 
cannot be excluded. The amount of fluid would not be amenable to 
image-guided joint aspiration. This would be an atypical 
location for diabetic myonecrosis. 

EKG ___
Sinus rhythm. Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. Cannot 
exclude ischemia. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ T 
wave abnormalities are more prominent in leads V2-V4. 

US LEFT SHOULDER ___
There is no evidence of focal fluid collection around the region 
of pain. No soft tissue calcifications are identified. 

MR THIGHS ___
IMPRESSION: Myositis involving the left quadriceps groups, most 
severely 
affecting the left vastus lateralis and vastus medialis as 
detailed above.  Differential considerations include infectious 
and inflammatory myositis, including drug reaction, as well as 
diabetic myonecrosis. No evidence of focal fluid collection or 
other sign of abscess formation. 

PATHOLOGY ___ Muscle Biopsy
- Pending at time of discharge
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y.o male with history of DM and remote MI who presents to the 
hospital today with right shoulder pain and MRI findings showing 
edema of the trapezius and deltoid muscles.  

Pt was admitted to the medicine service where pain control was 
initiated with tylenol and oxycodone.  His renal failure 
resolved with IVF.  Trial of NSAIDs was used x 2 however each 
with bump in Cr, so pt was discharged off of NSAIDs.  
Rheumatology was consulted and as per their recommendations, MRI 
of thighs was done (read in previous section) and mm bx of left 
deltoid done with with ACS c/s.  Given lack of microrganisms on 
the gram stain, and PMNs likely c/w inflammation, steroids were 
started once an infx was r/o.  The patient was also seen by ___ 
who recommended outpt ___ as well as shoulder exercises for the 
patient.  Statin was briefly stopped, however restarted given 
normalizing CK with hydration.

# Myositis/arthropathy - Upon presentation, ddx was broad and as 
such, many tests were checked including ASO (titer 400-800, 
positive), lyme serology (negative), CK for statin induced 
myopathy (400, resolved with IVF), and trichinella Ab (pending 
at time of discharge).  Pt's family most concerned with PMR, 
however reassured pattern does not seem c/w this.  ESR and CRP 
were checked which were elevated (87 and 243 respectively).  
Blood Cx were also checked given possible pyomyositis, thought 
from diabetic foot ulcer, however they remained NGTD throughout 
hospitalization.  Rheumatology was c/s who felt that MRI thigh 
was indicated which showed unilateral myositis in the left 
quadriceps group.  Notably, on exam the patient seemed to show 
pain to both passive and active movement, and as such we felt 
that he likely had both a problem in his joints as well as the 
actual muscles.  A muscle biopsy was done with the ___ team c/s 
which upon initial gram stain was negative for microorganisms, 
which allowed us to start steroids (we were concerned about 
possible pyomyositis).  Also of concern was diabetic 
myonecrosis, however unlikely given that multiple mm groups with 
different blood supply was involved.  Rheumatology felt it was 
possible that the pain in both the left AC joint as well as the 
pes anserinus on the right leg (which developed on HD3), may 
both be crystal arthropathy/bursitis, and as such recommended 
steroids.  We held off on empiric steroids until after the bx, 
and upon initiation, drastic improvement on sxs was noted.  
Ultimately, thought was that possibly myositis ___ traumatic 
fall on left hand side with underlying crystal arthropathy 
(however not enough fluid on MRI or US to tap).  he will have 
rheumatology f/u in the ___ system, and our rheumatology c/s 
attdg will attempt to contact his outpt rheumatologist for 
continuity of care.  He was discharged with a prednisone taper 
and close f/u with his PCP.

# Acute renal failure - Fena was <1%, and BUN/Cr ratio >10.  As 
such thought was that this was likely prerenal.  With hydration, 
Cr down to 1.0.  NSAIDs were attempted for pain relief which 
helped, unfortunately his Cr again bumped so NSAIDs were 
discontinued and the patient was asked to avoid them at time of 
discharge.
  
# Diabetes - continued home regimen of lantus and HISS.  
Notably, pt did have higher blood sugars upon initation of his 
steroids.  The patient was advised to closely monitor his BS at 
home to cover himself with SSI.  notably, diabetic myonecrosis 
was on the ddx however we felt this was unlikely given the 
location of the myositis.  There was also thought of possible 
contribution of his diabetes and insulin usage to a possible 
adhesive capsulitis in the left shoulder.

# Anemia: Pt's hct was 40 upon presentation, and dropped to 32 
over his hospitalization in the setting of aggressive hydration 
for ARF.  Notably, guaiac was negative, and iron studies were 
c/w anemia of chronic inflammation

# Constipation: Pt developed narcotic induced constipation, and 
an aggressive bowel regimen was written for him.  he required an 
enema in order to pass stools, and as such, he was discharged 
with an aggressive prescription regimen for his constipation.

# Foot ulcer: Pt has known DM with foot ulcer, followed by 
podiatry.  Wound c/s was asked to see patient who assisted with 
foot ulcer care.  No concern of osteo.  Out of slight concern of 
possible contribution to a ""pyomyositis-like picture,"" we 
checked blood Cx which were negative at time of discharge.
  
# Hypertension - continued atenolol.  
 
# History of CAD - continued ASA, atenolol as prior.  Statin was 
briefly stopped and reinitiated at time of discharge given 
normal CK.

# FOLLOW UP ISSUES
Pt had blood cx and a trichinella ag test pending at time of 
discharge
Pt will need to f/u with rheumatology within ___.  Our 
rheumatology attending at the ___ will attempt to contact his 
new rheumatologist for continuity of care.

___- PICC line placement in Right arm

 
History of Present Illness:
___ year old Male with Type 2 Diabetes, CAD s/p 2 stents 
___ discharged after admission for shoulder and thigh 
pain thought to be myositis and sent out on steroids, who now 
presents from clinic with gram positive cocci from AC shoulder 
joint aspiration.

He originally presented ___ with progressive left 
shoulder, Right knee, and Left thigh pain for several weeks. 
During this hospitalization, a rheumatology consult was 
obtained. He had an MRI of the Left shoulder that showed edema 
in the trapezius and deltoid muscles, consistent with 
nonspecific myositis and trace amount of fluid in the 
acromioclavicular joint. MRI of the thigh showed myositis 
involving the left quadriceps. Ultrasound of the shoulder showed 
no focal fluid collection. A muscle biopsy of the left shoulder 
muscle was also performed, final path is still pending but gram 
stain was negative and to date tissue cultures have been 
negative. Remainder of the extensive workup included: lyme, ASO, 
and blood cultures that have all been negative, GC/chlamydia 
still are pending. Pt was sent home and started a short course 
of steroids which he completed ___ for presumed inflammatory 
myositis.  

Pt states that on discharge he had some improvement in his 
shoulder pain with the steroids. On day of admission, he had 
fevers to 101, rigors and chills. He denies rash, nausea, 
dyspnea, recent trauma or surgeries.  

He was seen by his PCP on the day of admission for increaced 
pain and new cellulities of the Left foot. Labs showed elevated 
ESR/CRP (100/202) concerning for acute infection. He was then 
evaluated by rheumatology, where his AC joint was again 
aspirated this time with fluid washout and a prelim 
culture/gramstain grew gram positive cocci.

In the ED, initial VS: T 989.8, BP 107/56, HR 73, RR 18. His 
labs were notable for leukocytosis 16.7 w/ left shift, UA neg, 
Cr 1.2. CXR wnl. Ortho was consulted who recommended iv abx, 
admission for washout of the AC joint in the OR. Pt received iv 
zosyn/vancomycin.

      A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of 
mycobacteria or
      filamentous fungi.  A negative result should be 
interpreted with
      caution.  Whenever possible tissue biopsy or aspirated 
fluid should
      be submitted. 

FOOT AP,LAT & OBL LEFT ___
Three views of the left foot demonstrate patchy osteopenia of 
the forefoot.
No frank osteomyelitis identified. No cortical erosions.
Small os naviculare and small os peroneum. Small dorsal and 
plantar calcaneal enthesophytes. Mild dorsal soft tissue 
swelling.

MRI of foot ___
1. No evidence of osteomyelitis of the first metatarsal head.
 
2. Diffuse edema pattern of the mid foot, in absence of direct 
extension of
soft tissue abnormality is suggestive of Charcot 
osteoarthropathy;
osteomyelitis is considered much less likely.
 
3. Tiny fluid collection at the plantar aspect of the second 
intermetatarsal space could be due to altered mechanics in the 
setting of neuroarthropathy however presence of infection is not 
excluded. Please note, that this would not be amenable to 
percutaneous aspiration. Larger focal fluid in close proximity 
to the peroneus longus tendon, similarly, can represent focal 
tenosynovitis, though, alternatively, infected fluid collection 
may be present.

Transthoracic Echo ___
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately 
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly 
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no 
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. 
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is no pericardial effusion.

No vegetations seen.

If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D 
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.  

CXR ___
The PICC line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. 
Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is unchanged including mild cardiomegaly. Lungs are 
essentially
clear except for scarring at the left lower lung laterally. No 
pleural
effusion, no pneumothorax noted.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M  with type II diabetes mellitus, CAD (s/p 2 stents in 
___, and recent admission for work up of myositis was admitted 
with positive culture of left shoulder joint admitted with 
septic arthritis and found to be bacteremic and to ahve 
cellulitis.

#Septic Arthritis of Left AC joint, Bacteremia and Cellulitis:
Patient was found to have Beta Hemolytic Group G streptococuss 
septic arthritis and bactermeia.  He was originally started on 
vancomycin and then switched to vancomycin for better coverage 
of streptococus on ___.  He underwent an I&D of his left AC 
joint by orthopedics without complication.  After antibiotics 
were on board for multiple days patient remained afebrile. At no 
point was he hemodynamically under or showing signs of sepsis.  
For his foot cellulitis he had an xray and MRI which did not 
show any evidence of osteomyelitis.  In work-up for the source 
of this infection, he underwent a TTE which did not show any 
vegetations.  A TEE was deferred per Infectious disease as his 
course of treatment would not be changed.  A PICC Line was 
placed in his right antecub on ___ and position was verified 
with cxr.  He will be receiving home IV abx until ___. He 
will have follow- up in ID outpatient clinic, with weekly labs 
faxed to them by the ___.  He will have follow-up by orthopedics 
for his post-op I&D. He has follow-up with his own outside 
podiatrist for his foot ulcer and cellulitis. 

# Elevated alk phos-
The day prior to his discharge a repeat alkphos showed elevation 
compared to earlier in his hospitalization with an associated 
elevated GGT.  THe next day there was a decrease and ID felt 
comfortable with discharging him on ceftriaxone with weekly 
monitoring for any hepatic problems from the antibiotics.

#Constipation- 
Patient had constipation during his hospital stay. He at no time 
complained of abdominal pain, and moved his bowels prior to 
discharge. He was discharged on a bowel regimen and encouraged 
to use it while on narcotic pain medications.

#Diabetes, type 2 uncontrolled with complications-
Patient was kept on his home Insulin of 50units of glargine at 
bedtime except while NPO. He will be discharged on this same 
regimen without changes.

#HTN/CAD, native-
Patient had no episodes of hypertensive urgency or chest pain 
during his admission

Transitional Care
-Pt still has outstanding pending blood cultures
-Pt requires follow-up for physical therapy of his left foot and 
his left shoulder
-Pt will have follow-up with his PCP, ___, 
orthopedics and podiatry
-Pt will require weekly blood draws to be faxed to the ___ 
clinic
-Pt has a PICC line in his Right antecubital fossa, placed on 
___ and verified position by chest xray
-Pt is full code
-As this is his second admission during the past month there is 
concern for readmission, however as the etiology of his shoulder 
pain has been identified and is being treated with clinical 
improvement, it is unlikely he will be admitted.
-Pt is full code

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because of positive bacteria 
cultures from your shoulder aspirate.  During your stay you were 
found to be bactermic (bacteria in your blood) and to have 
cellulitis of your left foot (skin infection of the skin of your 
left foot). You had a transthoracic echo (ultrasound of your 
heart) which showed no signs of endocarditis as the cause of the 
bacteremia.  The blood cultures and swab of shoulder joint grew 
out the bacteria Streptococcus Group G and we narrowed your 
antibiotic treatment to ceftriaxone which was started on 
___.  You had an Incision and Drainage of your shoulder to 
clean out the bacteria. This infection requires a long course of 
antibiotics so you were given a PICC (peripherally inserted 
central catheter)on ___ prior to being discharged to receive 
your antibiotics at home.  Your foot with the chronic ulcer on 
the left foot showed signs of cellulitis (infection of the skin) 
in the left foot. You had both an xray and an MRI which showed 
no evidence of osteomyelitis (bone infection) of the bones of 
your foot/ankle.  The cellulitis improved with your IV 
antibiotic treatment during your stay.  Physical therapy saw you 
and felt that you would benefit from outpatient physical therapy 
after discharge.
For your diabetes you were kept on your home dose of insulin. 
You were constipated throughout your hospital stay but passed 
stool on the day of discharge.

History of Present Illness:
___ male w/ PMH of sarcoidosis, sleep apnea, new-onset 
dementia of unknown etiolgy, hx of ITP s/p splenectomy presents 
to ED after falling at home in the setting of confusion and 
recent diagnosis of dementia. Per patient, he was in the bathtub 
taking a shower, when he began to feel nauseous and spit 
up/vomited, felt dizzy, slipped, and fell in the tub. Denies any 
chest pain, sob, headache, palpitations. Wife found him in the 
tub. Per wife, did not appear like he lost consciousness, no 
urine/stool incontinence, no confusion at the time. He was 
shivering/rigoring and she took him to the bed with help of ___ 
to cover him with his electrical warming blanket. Patient 
insisted to going to the bathroom, but appeared more confused, 
urinating on the floor, not knowing where he was, and staring 
into space ('deer in a headlight'). Wife called the ambulance. 

Of note, patient also has had three other mechanical falls in 
the past. In ___, he fell while coming down 
the ladder; a few months ago, lost his balance while emptying 
shelves in his refrigerator and fell backawards; and last month 
fell when going to the bathroom with the lights off. 

Patient also has had ___ years of intermittent fevers (as high as 
104) and rigors in the setting of systemic sarcoidosis. Per 
wife, he usually takes an aleve and his fever/rigors resolves. 
She has not noticed any relationship between his fevers/rigors 
and confusion. Yesterday, was the only time that his 
fevers/rigors had been associated with an event of confusion. 
Starting 6 months ago, wife and children has noticed that 
patient has become more altered -- forgetting how to do 
something, confused about where he was driving to, forgetting 
what he needed to get at the store, leaving home in his car then 
calling saying he doesn't know where he is. He has been recently 
given a diagnosis of dementia. He has progressively gotten more 
confused in the last few month including yesterday in which he 
was urinating on the floor as he did not know where he was. He 
also has been getting higher fevers including a fever of ___ 
yesterday. Recently hospitalized at ___ from ___ for bronchitis, influenza, pneumonia, and toxic metabolic 
encephalopathy with underlying dementia. Workup at the time was 
negative for TSH, RPR, EEG, MRI. 
.  
In the ED, case management evaluated him given wife's concerns 
that he requires more aid at home and because of his fevers, 
high white count, systemic problems, the patient admitted for 
rehab placement. Trauma evaluation in the ED was negative for 
acutely concerning injuries.  
.  
In ED VS were 101.9 110 124/58 16 97%  
Labs were remarkable for Cre 1.3 (near baseline), WBC ~21 (also 
chronically elevated), Ca of 10.7, U/A Trace ___, WBC 8, Epi 0, 
Nitrite neg. Few bacteria.  
Imaging: head CT- no evidence of acute intracranial injury, CXR: 
stable opacities on wet read  
Interventions: given CTX 1g  
.  
Of note, patient has not been taking his prednisone for about a 
month. Reports that he stopped taking the medication because he 
heard that prednisone can cause thining of his bones. Per wife, 
he used to swim for miles several times per week, do yardwork, 
walk dog daily. Able to perform yardwork during last ___, 
but wife has noticed that he is more tired than usual during the 
last 2 months and has limited most of his physical activities.

  Intervals Axes 
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 
96 136 96 352/415 59 -30 58  

___ CXR (PA & LAT)
IMPRESSION: Scattered opacities in the lungs, as seen on prior 
chest 
radiographs, could represent pneumonia or sarcoidosis flair.  
Consider CT to further assess. 

___ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
FINDINGS:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, 
mass effect or major vascular territorial infarct. Prominent 
ventricles and sulci are 
unchanged and compatible with mild global age-related volume 
loss.  Basal 
cisterns are preserved.  There is no shift of normally midline 
structures. Hypoattenuation in the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter is unchanged and likely sequelae of 
chronic microvascular ischemic disease.  Gray-white matter 
differentiation is preserved.  No calvarial fracture is 
identified.  There is mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air 
cells, with tiny air-fluid levels in the sphenoid sinuses.  The 
remainder of the visualized paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells 
and middle ear cavities are clear. 
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial injury. 

___ CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST
FINDINGS:  Scarring and bronchiectasis within the right upper 
lobe is 
unchanged in appearance and likely the sequela of this patients 
sarcoid.  
Right upper lobe chain suture reflects prior wedge resection.  
Multiple new peribronchovascular nodules are predominantly basal 
and peripheral, some of which show a characteristic flame-shaped 
appearance (4; 113).  For example, a right lower lobe nodule 
abuts the pleural surface, contains an air bronchogram, and 
measures 2.8 x 2.3 cm;  a left lower lobe nodule also contains 
traversing air-filled bronchi and measures 2.5 x 1.8 cm.  The 
pleural surfaces are normal.  The airways remain patent and 
normal appearing, with a small amount of adherent mucus within 
the trachea.   
  
Central lymph nodes are mildly enlarged from the prior study, 
including a 
1.5-cm right lower paratracheal node, a 9-mm prevascular node, 
and a 1.3-cm subcarinal node.  The heart is normal in size 
without pericardial effusion.  The great vessels are normal in 
size and configuration.  A physiologic amount of fluid is seen 
in the posterior superior aortic recess.  There is moderate 
calcification of the visualized coronary arteries. 
  
While this exam is not tailored for evaluation of structures 
beneath the 
diaphragm, it shows prominent retrocrural lymph nodes.  The 
thyroid gland is normal appearing.  There is moderate thoracic 
spinal degenerative disc change. Compression deformity of the 
T12 vertebral body is similar in appearance to the chest 
radiograph performed ___, but new from ___. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Marked increase in basilar and peripheral prominence of 
peribronchovascular nodules, some of which have a characteristic 
flame-shaped appearance suggestive of sarcoid, however, in the 
clinical setting of leukocytosis and fever, infection cannot be 
excluded. 
2.  T12 wedge deformity, unchanged from ___ and 
new from ___. 

___ ECHO 
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no 
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 
normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular wall thickness and cavity 
size with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic 
function. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Normal pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male w/ PMH of sarcoidosis, sleep apnea on CPAP, 
new-onset dementia of unknown etiology, hx of ITP s/p distant 
splenectomy presents to ED after falling at home in the setting 
of rapid progressive cognitive decline for the last six months, 
intermittent fevers and leukocytosis for ___ years, and recent 
pna.   
  
# Confusion: per wife's report, confusion started worsening more 
rapidly during the last 6 months, but also in setting of being 
diagnosed with influenza/pneumonia in ___. 
Per wife, his mental status waxes and wanes and sometimes in 
relation to fevers. An extensive workup was done at ___ 
___ during his last hospitalziation (discharged on ___ 
for pneumonia, influenza, confusion) and was attributed to toxic 
metabolic encephalopathy (TME) secondary to influenza and 
pneumonia with underlying dementia over past 6 months which has 
progressed. Evaluated by Neurology during that admission - EEG 
showed no seizures, MRI showed chronic small vessel infarcts but 
no acute disease, Vitamin B12, TSH, RPR, lead level were normal. 
LP was deferred. Infectious workup here so far been negative 
(urine culture negative, blood cx with no growth to date, LP 
unremarkable with negative HSV, cryptococcus, and CSF culture), 
however CXR with possible pna vs. sarcoidosis flare. CT chest 
obtained showing new prominent markings of pulmonary nodules. 
Concern for infection vs. neurosarcoidosis/sarcoid flare given 
acute progression of his dementia, immunosuppresed with disease 
process, self-discontinuation of prednisone for one month, and 
leukocytosis with intermittent fevers/rigors. Leukocytosis has 
been occurring for about ___ years, but his white count has not 
been as high previously, which was concerning for an acute 
infection or acute sarcoid flare. 

Neurosarcoid was unlikely as no typical MRI changes and no 
cranial nerves involvement. Patient also without any neuro 
deficits on physical exam and LP opening pressure was normal at 
15cc. Leukocytosis, intermittent fevers, hypercalcemia, and 
recent 20# weight loss in the past year also concerning for 
possible malignancy. Per OMR, patient had extensive workup for 
possible lymphoma including biopsy with Dr. ___ was all 
negative. CSF cytology, SPEP, and UPEP were negative during this 
admission. HIV also negative. 

The pulmonary and rheumatology teams were consulted and both 
teams agreed that the patient could be having a sarcoid flare. 
As a result, he was started on prednisone 60mg on ___ with 
close follow up with rheumatology. He was also started on 
prophylactic alendronate weekly and PCP ppx with bactrim. At 
discharge, patient was afebrile, asymptomatic, with mental 
status at baseline. 

# cough/leukocytosis/intermittent fevers:  
Leukocytosis/intermittent fevers appears chronic and going in 
for about ___ years as per above. Per wife, various workup in the 
past and attributed to sarcoid +/- steroids. Patient was 
recently diagnosed with PNA/influenza and completed treatment 
with tamiflu and long course of cefpodoxine for pna. 
Differential also includes possible sarcoids flare as per above 
since patient has not been taking prednisone for last 1 month. 
CT chest with new prominence of nodules but per pulmonary team 
low suspicion for infectious process. Infectious workup 
including LP not suggestive of infection, thus attributed to 
sarcoid flare. Started on prednisone 60mg daily. Will follow up 
with rheumatology who will determine length of prednisone.  

# Sarcoidosis: c/b uveitis, ileocolitis, and pulmonary 
involvement. Patient self-discontinued prednisone for 1 month. 
Has no seen Dr. ___ since ___.   

# recent falls: previous falls per history appears mechanical 
(falling off the ladder and loosing balance when transferring 
food from the refrigerator shelves). Fall on day prior to 
admission most likely a vaso-vagal episode as he vomited, felt 
dizzy, and then fell in the tub. Unclear if loss consciousness 
as wife found him in the tub. Denied any palpitations, cp, 
urine/bowel incontinence, abnormal body movements, or weakness 
to suggest cardiac, seizures, or stroke. Negative orthostatics 
on ___, no events on telemetry for 24 hours. CT head w/o 
contrast without signs of bleeding or acute intracranial 
process. ___ and OT evaluated patient and recommended discharge 
to home. 

# Pyuria: Received CTX x1 in ED for presumed UTI. Patient was 
asymptomatic, thus treatment was not continued. Urine culture 
with no growth. 

# Acute kidney injury: On admission Cr. 1.3. Likely secondary to 
dehydration and decreased PO intake. Given IVF in ED and another 
liter overnight and creatinine returned to normal. At discharge, 
creatinine was 1.   
.  
INACTIVE ISSUES:  
# Depression:  continued on home fluoxetine   
# HLD: continued on home statin

# TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
-unclear etiology of acute worsening confusion, leukocytosis, 
and intermittent fevers, but may be secondary to systemic 
sarcoidosis. Prednisone increased to 60mg daily with close 
follow up with rheumatology and pulmonology
-on bactrim and alendronate while on prednisone
-CSF cytology negative for malignant cell, negative crypto, 
negative fungal and viral culture. Ruled out infection.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at ___ 
___. You were admitted to the 
hospital because of confusion and a recent fall. You were also 
found to have high white counts (which usually happens during an 
infection) and occasional fevers. We sent various test including 
the fluid in your spine and there was no active infection. You 
were seen by the rheumatology and the pulmonary team regarding 
your sarcoidosis. The teams felt that you may be having a 
sarcoidosis flare and as a result your prednisone was increased 
to 60mg daily. Please MAKE SURE you take prednisone 60mg DAILY. 
While you are on this medication, you are at risk for a lung 
infection called PCP and as ___ result, you will also need to take 
bactrim daily to prevent the infection. While on prednisone, you 
are also at risk for bone loss and as a result, you will need to 
take alendronate weekly to prevent this. 

Please make sure you follow up with your primary care physician, 
___, and pulmonology.

IMAGING:
MRI BACK: This examination was interpreted in conjunction with 
the ___ MRI examination performed rougly 4 hours 
earlier, at 1430h on ___.  When compared to the prior 
examination of ___, there are new T6 and T8 vertebral 
body compression fractures similar to the examination performed 
earlier this date.  A T11 compression fracture appears unchanged 
since the prior examination of ___.  An L1 compression 
fracture is also noted; however, this level was not included in 
the field of view in the examination in ___.  
As noted on the prior examination performed earlier the same 
day, there is a T1 hyperintense and T2 intermediate signal 
posterior epidural collection, extending from the T4 to T8-T9 
level.  This collection suppresses on the STIR sequence but 
demonstrates low-intermediate T2-signal, compatible with blood 
products.  At the T6 level, this V-shaped collection surrounds 
the cord, resulting in transverse compression of the cord 
without evidence of abnormal signal in the cord substance.  At 
the T6-T7 level, there is abnormal T2/STIR signal in the 
interspinous ligament suggesting relatively acute ligamentous 
injury.  Therefore, the constellation of these findings suggests 
___ ""three-column"" type injury with an associated epidural 
hematoma, most pronounced at T6 level.  
 
IMPRESSION:
1. New T6 and T8 compression fractures as described.  Epidural 
hematoma extending from T4 to T8-T9 levels with transverse 
compression of the cord at T6 level, without evidence of 
abnormal cord signal. 
2. Abnormal signal in the T6-T7 interspinous soft tissues 
suggesting ligamentous injury which in conjunction with the 
compression fracture of the T6 vertebral body is concerning for 
___ ""three-column"" injury.  With the possibility of 
instablility at this level, an urgent neurosurgical consult is 
advised.
3. T12 compression fracture, unchanged. 
4. L1 compression fracture, progressed since the prior CT torso 
of ___.

and epidural fluid collection.  

# Thoracic spine compression fracture and epidural hematoma with 
moderate cord compression. Exam showed some ___ weakness and 
hyper-relfexia, but they do not correspond to the level of the 
compression or the fluid collection. There is concern for 
epidural hematoma as a result of the new spine compression 
fracture, vs. epidural abscess (given mildly elevated WBC, left 
shift, 2% bands) but radiology was comfortable with diagnosis of 
hematoma by radiographic evidence. Blood cultures were drawn and 
had no growth. There was no radiographic evidence of 
osteomyelitis. Patient has many compression fracture, likely 
result of long term steroid use, despite being on vitamin D and 
alenodronate. The patient reported that he had not been taking 
his calcium as he did not like the GI side effects of the 
medication.  The patient neuro exam was stable. He was seen by 
spine surgery who felt that there was no role for intervention 
and he was fitted with a TLSO brace with outpatient follow up in 
the ___.  The patient will also follow up with 
endocrinology as an outpatient. 

# Sarcoidosis. Multiorgan involvement. Long standing use of 
prednisone, and also on azathioprine. The patient was seen by 
rheum in the hospital who recommended decrease of prednisone to 
30mg and taper to 20 in 1 week, increase the  azathioprine to 
150 mg daily. He will have outpatient labs drawn in 1 week to 
assess for side effects of the azathioprine. He will also 
continue on home bactrim, omeprazole and ursodiol. 

#Tachycardia: While in the hospital the patient had an episode 
of SVT, likely AVNRT based on EKG. The patient was asymptomatic 
during the event which lasted for several hours. At the end the 
patient reported mild shortness of breath. Several vagal 
maneuvers were attempted without success. Metoprol 5mg IV x3 was 
attempted without sucsess and the patient was given 15mg IV 
Diltiazem with breaking the rhythm. He will follow up as an 
outpatient with EP for formal consolation and consideration of 
an EP study. 

# Depression: Continued on home fluoxetine.

# HLD : Continued on home simvastatin 

# OSA: Continued on CPAP.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Compression Fractures: The patient was instructed to take his 
calcium. He will have outpatient follow up with endocrinology.

#Tachy arrhythmia: The patient will have outpatient follow up 
with EP for a formal consultation and evaluation.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in the 
hospital. You were admitted with back pain. You were found to 
have 2 new compression fractures and a small hematoma near your 
spinal cord. You were evaluated by the spine surgeons to see if 
there was any procedure to do. They decided there was none and 
had you fitted for the brace. Please wear the brace and do not 
twist. You had an episode of a fast heart rate while you were in 
the hospital. You were came out of the rate. We have set you up 
with an apointment with a cardiologist to discuss this and see 
if there is anything that needs to be done. Several of you

# ECHO ___
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is 
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Posterior MVP suspected but not 
clearly seen.. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of moderate 
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature 
of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly 
underestimated (Coanda effect). The tricuspid valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could 
not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable 
for review) of ___, no definite change.

IMAGING
# CXR ___
FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
 Left basilar 
atelectasis is seen.  There is left basilar and left mid lung 
atelectasis/scarring.  Chain sutures are noted overlying the 
right 
upper-to-mid hemithorax.  There is subtle focal patchy opacity 
projecting over 
the right lateral lower chest, which in the same location on the 
lateral view, 
appeared to be a linear opacity dating back to ___.  
Finding could 
represent atelectasis/scarring; however, on the current study, 
it appears more 
amorphous and a small focus of infection is not excluded.  The 
cardiac and 
mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is no pleural 
effusion or 
pneumothorax.  There is persistent moderate compression of 
multiple vertebral 
bodies including at least two mid thoracic and at least two in 
the 
thoracolumbar region, similar to the prior chest x-ray. 
# CXR ___
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___: 
  
Multifocal pulmonary consolidation is clearing.  Heart is normal 
size.  Right 
paratracheal mediastinal fullness, due in part to adenopathy is 
longstanding.  
No pleural effusion.  Heart size normal.  Right jugular line 
ends in the 
region of the superior cavoatrial junction. 
# CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST ___
FINDINGS: 
  
Aorta and pulmonary arteries are normal in diameter.  The right 
central venous 
line tip is at the level of right atrium.  No appreciable 
mediastinal 
lymphadenopathy is seen.  Within the limitations of this 
non-enhanced study, 
there is no evidence of hilar or axial lymphadenopathy.  No 
pericardial or 
pleural effusion.  Increased density of the myocardium as 
compared to the 
blood in the chambers of the left ventricle is consistent with 
anemia. 
  
Airways are patent till the subsegmental level bilaterally. 
Right upper lobe 
scarring is unchanged with volume loss and slight bronchial 
distortion.  Left 
upper lobe scarring is unchanged.  Pulmonary nodules scattered 
throughout the 
lungs are all stable with no new pulmonary nodules, masses or 
consolidations 
to suggest infectious process. 
  
There are no lytic or sclerotic lesions worrisome for infection 
or neoplasm.  
Multiple compression fractures are redemonstrated and can be 
seen at least 
back on ___ chest radiograph.  No new lesions seen. 

  
The imaged portion of the upper abdomen reveals no appreciable 
abnormality. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1.  No evidence of new pulmonary abnormalities to be attributed 
to neutropenic 
fever. 
  
2.  Unchanged appearance of the chronic changes related to known 
sarcoidosis. 
  
3.  Status post splenectomy.  Evidence of anemia. 
  
4.  Multiple compression fractures of the thoracic spine, 
gallstones, 
unchanged. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with h/o Hodgkin's lymphoma C1D17 ABVD, sarcoidosis, 
OSA on CPAP, h/o AVNRT, presented with neutropenic fever and 
SVT.

MICU Course:  
============
Pt. was initially admitted to the MICU for hemodynamic 
instability requiring pressors (levo) in the setting of presumed 
neutropenic fever and sepsis.  Pt.'s hemodynamics quickly 
improved once starting cefepime/vancomycin with fluid 
resuscitation.  He was also noted to have a downtrending 
lactate.  He was quickly weaned off of pressors and transferred 
to the floor.

Floor Course:
=============
# Neutropenic fever, no clear source identified: p/w T102.2 at 
home, initially met ___ SIRS criteria. lactate 3.2 on admisison, 
resolved s/p fluid resuscitation. fever quickly resolved the day 
after admission. vanc/cefepime d/c'd ___ and ___, respectively, 
without new fever. Pt finished a course of levofloxacin for 
community acquired pneumonia, also w/o recurrence of fever and 
no futher pulmonary symptoms.  Course notable for new 
leukocytosis with watery diarrhea, c. diff ordered, but no BM 
since. stool culture negative, O&P negative. Leukocytosis likely 
related to underlying malignancy. Culture with negative 
respiratory virus studies, negative urine culture, Blood cx 
NGTD.  CT negative for pneumonia. 

# AVNRT: Pt presented with reported (ED EKG not recovered) 
SVT/AVNRT to 130s with decreased BP x 2, spontaneously resolved 
in the ED.  Has h/o 2 AVNRT per ___ cardiology consult note. 
  At that time they did not suspect cardiac sarcoid as a 
causative agent, based on TTE/EKG. Catheter-ablation was 
discussed but pt declined and pt not currently a candidate given 
immunocompromised state. Beta-blockers were advised; pt did not 
respond to esmolol gtt in ED. Initial cardiology impression was 
that the tachycardia may be more related to presentation of 
SIRS. Pt was noted to have another episode of AVNRT during the 
hospital stay with HR to 140.  The AVNRT once again 
spontaneously resolved. Pt was restarted on home dose of 
metoprolol in short-acting forms once pt's BP improved with no 
further episodes of AVNRT noted.

# Port placement c/b bleed - pt received port placement ___. He 
was noted to have oozing from dressing site post procedure day 
1. Prophylactic dosing of heparin was discontinued given 
isolated PTT elevation.  His PTT normalized.  Pressure dressing 
was placed on the port site.  Interventional radiology 
re-examined the port and noted small bleeding vessel underneath 
the port, which was cauterized by ___. Pt was monitored for 
24hours afterwards with no re-bleeding.  Port was ok to access 
per ___.
 
# Hodgkin's Lymphoma: stage IV. admitted in C1 of ABVD .Most 
recent PET CT scan on ___ showed 1) hilar, mesenteric, and 
RP LAD; 2)New scattered FDG-avid foci in the liver and pancreas. 
3) New focus of FDG-avidity in the L2 vertebral body. Received 
D1 of C1 of ABVD on ___. Immuran stopped and PSE dose 
reduced to 30mg/day from 40mg/day. ___: PSE dose reduced to 
25mg/day, but increased to 30mg/day on ___. PFT obtained, which 
showed reduced diffusing capacity. Bleomycin was therefore held. 
 ECHO was obtained with good EF and no wall motion 
abnormalities.  Pt received AVD in house prior to discharge. Pt 
was continued on Fluconazole 400 mg PO Q24H, Acyclovir 400 mg PO 
Q8H, and Sulfameth/Trimethoprim SS 1 TAB PO DAILY for 
prophylaxis.

# Normocytic Anemia: Hct stable this am. No gross signs of 
bleeding on transfer to floor. decrease in hct initially may be 
related to dilutional effect in the setting of fluid 
resuscitation - though pt did not experience similar decrease 
his other cell lines.  Pt remains asymptomatic in regards to his 
anemia. no dizziness/light headedness or palpitation.  His 
hgb/hct remained stable and did not require transfusion.

# Sarcoidosis: thought to involve skin, gut, eyes and lungs, and 
presumed neurosarcoidosis in the form of headaches. Followed by 
rheumatology and pulmonary service for ___ years. In this time, 
he has been off steroids only for ~1 month.  s/p stress dose 
steroid in the ED for possible iatrogenic adrenal suppression in 
the settingn of hypotension. Pt was restarted on prednisone 30mg 
PO daily, and remained stable on regimen.

# Depression: no SI/HI on admission. stable on home Fluoxetine 
40 mg PO DAILY 
 
# HLD: stable on Simvastatin 20 mg PO DAILY 
 
# OSA: stable on CPAP at night

IMAGING:
CT HEAD ___: 1.  No evidence of acute intracranial process.  
No focal enhancement or 
pachymeningeal enhancement identified, although the study is 
suboptimal for 
assessment of neurosarcoidosis.  If there is further clinical 
concern, a 
contrast-enhanced brain MRI should be performed.   
  
2.  Air-fluid levels in the sphenoid sinuses compatible with 
acute 
inflammatory sinus disease. 

CXR ___: Allowing for differences in technique and 
projection, there has 
been little interval change in the appearance of the chest since 
the previous 
radiograph, with no new focal areas of consolidation to suggest 
the presence 
of pneumonia.  Multifocal linear areas of scarring appear 
unchanged, 
previously attributed to sarcoidosis.  Band-like opacity at 
periphery of left 
lung base has slightly worsened and is attributed to localize 
atelectasis. 

MR EXAMINATION OF BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST, MRA OF THE 
HEAD WITHOUT 
CONTRAST, MRA OF THE NECK WITH CONTRAST, ___   
1.  No acute intracranial abnormality. 
2.  Progressive multifocal T2-hyperintensities in bihemispheric 
and central 
pontine white matter, which may represent sequelae of chronic 
small vessel 
ischemic disease, neurosarcoidosis, or a combination of the two. 

3.  No pathologic parenchymal, leptomeningeal or dural 
enhancement to suggest 
active inflammation related to neurosarcoidosis. 
4.  Unremarkable cranial and cervical MRA, with no significant 
mural 
irregularity, flow-limiting stenosis or evidence of dissection. 
5.  Inflammatory disease involving, particularly the sphenoid 
air cells, with 
likely layering fluid, suggesting an acute component; this 
should be 
correlated clinically, as there is also a small amount of 
layering fluid in 
the nasopharynx and fluid-opacification of scattered mastoid air 
cells, which 
may relate to protracted supine positioning. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ M with stage IV Hodgkin's Lymphoma C2D3 
(on ___ of ABVD, as well as h/o systemic sarcoid on 
prednisone, here after altered mental status/pre-syncope during 
dacarbazine infusion ___. 

# Altered Mental Status/Pre-Syncope: Differential diagnosis on 
admission included allergic reaction, stroke, seizure, and 
cardiogenic syncope. The patient has a history of presumed 
neurosarcoid making an intracranial process more likely. Seizure 
less likely given no tonic-clonic movements and no post-ictal 
confusion. Neurology was consulted in the ED. Head CT negative 
for acute process. Head and neck MRI/MRA was checked on ___ and 
showed progressive multifocal T2 hyperintensity in bihemispheric 
and central pontine white matter; could represent small vessel 
ischemic disease and/or neurosarcoidosis. There was no 
pathologic enhancement to suggest active inflammation due to 
neurosarcoidosis. The MRA of head and neck was unremarkable. An 
EEG was checked but results were pending at the time of 
discharge. The patient ruled out for cardiac ischemia/infarction 
with a normal EKG and negative cardiac enzymes. He was monitored 
on telemetry for 24 hours without event. Overall, it's unclear 
what caused the pre-syncope and altered mental status. The 
patient's cognitive function rapidly returned to normal even 
prior to admission and remained stable throughout 
hospitalization. He will be admitted to the hospital for all 
future cycles of chemotherapy for closer monitoring.

# Stage IV Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Admitted on cycle 2 day 1 of 
ABVD. Did not get full dose of decarbazine on ___ due to 
pre-syncope. He received the remainder of the decarbazine dose 
on ___. He was continued on prophylaxis with fluconazole 400 mg 
PO/NG Q24H, Acyclovir 400 mg PO/NG Q8H, Sulfameth/Trimethoprim 
SS 1 TAB PO/NG DAILY. The patient will start Neupogen and Cipro 
on ___. He was started on allopurinol due to elevated uric 
acid.  

# Systemic Sarcoidosis: Involves skin, gut, eyes, lungs, and 
presumed neurosarcoid. On prednisone daily. He was continued on 
prednisone 25mg daily.  

# Depression: Stable. Continued on fluoxetine 40mg daily

# Obstructive Sleep Apnea. Compliant with home CPAP, which was 
continued during hospitalization.

# History of AVNRT. This was transient during prior 
hospitalization and likely related to sepsis. At that time, 
cardiology recommended conservative treatment with beta 
blockers, since invasive ablation contraindicated in this 
immunosuppressed pt. The patient was continued on metoprolol, 
but switched to short acting metoprolol tartrate 12.5mg BID 
while hospitalized.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-EEG results pending at discharge
-Patient will be admitted to the hospital for future 
chemotherapy
-Will start Neupogen and Cipro ___.
-New Rx for allopurinol

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure to care for you at ___. You were admitted 
after having a period of confusion and near-loss of 
consciousness while getting chemotherapy. A CT scan of your 
brain was normal. The MRI showed small lesions scattered 
throughout your brain that may be related to sarcoid, but could 
also be related to low blood flow in the tiniest blood vessels 
in your brain (a common finding as people age). The MRI did not 
show active inflammation in your brain from sarcoid, nor did it 
show a stroke- good news! An EEG was checked to look for seizure 
activity and the result is still pending.  We also monitored 
your heart function. Blood tests and an EKG did not reveal a 
heart attack. The electrical activity of your heart was normal 
over 24 hours of monitoring.

Overall, it's unclear why you experienced near-loss of 
consciousness and confusion with the chemotherapy. Dr. ___ 
___ that you be admitted to the hospital for all future 
administrations of chemotherapy to be cautious and allow for 
closer monitoring.

After returning home, please start Neupogen and Ciprofloxacin on 
___.

h/o AVNRT presents for scheduled chemotherapy with AVD.

# Stage IV Hodgkin's Lymphoma:
The patient was admitted for close monitoring during 
chemotherapy with AVD as he experienced pre-syncope during his 
last chemotherapy session. The patient tolerated chemotherapy 
well without any dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. He was 
continued on prophylaxis with acyclovir and bactrim. Fluconazole 
was held on the day of chemotherapy administration due to drug 
interactions.

# Orthostatic hypotension:
Patient noted to be orthostatic on admission. The patient 
described several episodes of dizziness with standing. The 
patient was recently evaluated by neurology and autonomic 
testing showed abnormal parasympathetic function and decreased 
sympathetic cholinergic function. Etiology of this is uncertain. 
It may be related to sarcoidosis. The patient also had some 
rigidity on exam, therefore he may have early parkinsonism as 
well. The patient was not orthostatic prior to discharge.
 
# H/o AVNRT:
The patient had a few episodes of AVNRT during previous 
admissions. The most recent episode occurred in the setting of 
sepsis. The patient was monitored on telemetry and had no 
episodes of tachycardia. Metoprolol was discontinued as this 
medication does not prevent SVT. Furthermore, beta blockade 
likely exacerbates his orthostatic hypotension.

# Anemia:
Likely secondary to chemotherapy. Given shortness of breath, the 
patient was transfused 1 unit with an appropriate rise in Hct. 
 
# Systemic Sarcoidosis: 
Involves skin, gut, eyes, lungs, and presumed neurosarcoidosis. 
He was continued on prednisone 25mg daily. 

# Depression: Stable. Continued on fluoxetine 40mg daily.

# Obstructive Sleep Apnea: The patient refused CPAP. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient to follow up with primary oncologist.
- The patient was instructed to restart Neupogen on ___.
- Patient to have labs (CBC, Chem10, LFTs) on ___ or ___ 
(office will notify patient of appointment date).
- Encourage fluid and increased salt intake for orthostatic 
hypotension.
- Consider further workup including Neurology evaluation for 
orthostatic hypotension.
- Patient with abundant NRBCs on differential. Consider further 
work up as an outpatient.
- Code status: Full code

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo male with h/o Stage IV Hodgkin's lymphoma with marrow 
involvement on C3 of ABVD (c/b neutropenic sepsis and ? pulm 
fibrosis on C1, syncope on C2), systemic sarcoidosis w/ presumed 
neurosarcodosis tx with remicade in the past, OSA on CPAP, h/o 
AVNRT presents with neutropenic fever.
 
#Neutropenic fever: Unclear source. Was placed on Vanc/Cefepime 
and flagyl until afebrile x 24 hrs and ANC >1500. Diarrhea is 
the only potentially localizing symptom but was negative for 
c.diff, norovirus and viruses. Salmonella and shigella pending 
upon discharge but very unlikely giving no blood in stool. UA 
and Urine Cx negatve for infection. Blood cultures pending upon 
discharge but no growth to date. CXR no obvious focal 
consolidation. Respiratory viral panel negative. 

# Hodgkins lymphoma: D/c neupogen ___ with ANC >1500. Planning 
for Chemotherapy as outpatient on ___. Canceled PICC line on 
___ to be discussed as an outpatient. Opted not to place PICC 
per primary oncologist by discharge.

# h/o AVNRT: Per cardiology, benign and should not interfere 
with chemo. BB stopped last admission but then restarted by 
oncology which was continued during this hospital stay.

# Anemia: Likely chemo related. Stable. 

# Systemic Sarcoidosis: Involves skin, gut, eyes, lungs, and 
presumed neurosarcoidosis. Continued on prednisone ___ mg 
every other day. 

# Depression: Stable. Home fluoxetine 40mg daily.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

Thank you for choosing us for your care. You were admitted to 
the hospital for a very low white blood cell count, likely from 
your chemotherapy. We gave you a medicine, Neupogen, to restore 
your white blood cell counts and it came up appropriately.

Please discuss with your oncologist at your appointment tomorrow 
whether you should take any medicine to keep your white blood 
cell count up after chemotherapy sessions.

While here, you had continued diarrhea. We have done stool 
studies to make sure there were no major infectious causes of 
diarrhea. We are treating you symptomatically with Imodium 
(loperimide).

Your next dose of chemotherapy is scheduled for tomorrow 
(___) as below.

Imaging
=================================
CXR
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Post-surgical 
changes 
on the right.  Nodular opacity in the left upper lung, not 
clearly identified 
on prior exam, which should be followed on subsequent studies.  
No definite 
acute cardiopulmonary process. 

Chest CT
Although there has been no recurrence of previous lymph node 
enlargement and there are no enlarged lymph nodes currently, 
there has been an increase in peribronchial infiltration in 
three areas of the lung, the large fibrotic conglomerate in the 
right upper lobe, all of the basal segments in the left lower 
lobe, and peripherally in the anterior segment of the left upper 
lobe. One possible explanation is a flare of sarcoidosis, which 
classically has a peribronchial distribution like this, after 
the cessation of steroid therapy. Lymphoma is less likely since 
that is more prone to recur in lymph nodes. Calcific 
cholelithiasis, with possible ductal stones.  Clinical 
correlation 
advised. 

CXR
As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have 
slightly 
decreased. There is minimal fluid overload in both the vascular 
and 
interstitial compartment. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. 
Moderate 
tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No pleural effusions.  No 
pneumonia. 

CTA CHest
The aorta and pulmonary arteries are opacified.  There is no 
pulmonary 
embolism to subsegmental level.  The aorta maintains a normal 
contour without 
any evidence of acute aortic syndrome.  
  
Note is made of an enlarged right bronchial artery, originating 
off the medial 
aspect of the descending thoracic aorta at the level of the 
carina (series 4, 
image 49). This vessel supplies the fibrotic area in the right 
upper lobe and 
may represent the cause of the patient's hemoptysis.  
  
The heart is normal in size without pericardial effusion.  
Mildly prominent 
mediastinal lymph nodes in the pretracheal and right 
paratracheal stations are 
again seen, not pathologically enlarged. 
  
The central airways remain patent.  There is no pleural effusion 
or 
pneumothorax.  Again seen is increased peribronchial 
infiltration, most marked 
in the right upper lobe with nodularity and fibrosis. Increased 
soft tissue 
with consolidation  and air bronchograms is seen at the right 
hilum, similar 
in appearance to the prior study. Peribronchial changes are also 
seen in the 
left lower lobe and lingula.  
  
Oral contrast is still seen in the stomach. The remainder of the 
visualized 
portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. 
  
Again seen are compression fractures of T6 and T8 with greater 
than 50% loss 
of height, similar in appearance to ___.  There has 
been slight 
interval increase in depression of the superior endplate of the 
T5 vertebral 
body.  No suspicious osseous lesion is identified. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No pulmonary embolism or evidence of acute aortic syndrome. 
2.  Enlarged right bronchial artery supplying a consolidated 
fibrotic area in 
the right upper lobe. This may be the underlying cause of the 
patient's 
hemoptysis. 
3.  Peribronchial infiltration with nodularity and scarring, 
stable compared 
to the chest CT one day prior.  
4.  Compression fractures of T5, T6, and T8; the T5 fracture has 
increased 
since ___. 

ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the 
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened 
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
mild posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, 
anteriorly-directed jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its 
severity may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic 
function. Posterior MVP with severe eccentric mitral 
regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
mitral regurgitation is more severe. If further information on 
mitral valve morphology and severity of mitral regurgitation is 
clinically-indicated, would recommend a transesophageal study 
with 3D imaging.

CXR
A left-sided PICC is unchanged in position.  Cardiac and 
mediastinal contours 
are unchanged from the prior exam. There is no evidence of 
pulmonary edema. No 
effusions are identified. There is no pneumothorax. Surgical 
chain sutures are 
again seen in the right upper lobe consistent with prior 
surgery. Again, 
fullness to the right suprahilar region likely corresponds to a 
consolidative 
fibrotic area seen on recent chest CT dated ___. 

MRI Head
No acute intracranial abnormalities identified. Slight interval 
progression of multifocal FLAIR and T2 hyperintensities in the 
bihemispheric and central pontine white matter, which may 
represent sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease, 
neurosarcoidosis, or a combination of the two.

days of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dark colored stools 
found to be c diff positive on broad spectrum abx with hospital 
course complicated by AVNRT and MR. 

#C diff colitis: Patient presented with diarrhea and dark 
colored stools overnight initially treated empirically with 
ciproflagyl IV.  C dif studies returned positive and he was 
started on PO vancomycin and given neutropenia he was covered 
with IV cefepime and flagyl as well.  Neupagen was started and 
his WBC was monitored closely. He was no longer neutropenic on  
___ and the cefepime, flagyl and Neupagen were discontinued. 
His symptoms improved and he was discahrged with a planned 14 
day course of PO vancomycin. 

#Tachypnea/cough/wheezing/hemotysis:  Patient presented 
bibasilar crackles on exam along with orthopnea suggesting mild 
CHF. CTA negative for PE, but concerning bronchial artery close 
to RUL lesion, which may have explained scant hemoptysis. 
Pulmonary was consulted and believed respiratory symptoms maybe 
related to bronchitis vs sarcoid exacerbation.  Pulm recommended 
albuterol/ipratroprium nebs with inhaled Advair and continuing 
po steroids at home dosing.  O2 therapy was avoided given the 
patients history of bleomycin exposure.  An echo was performed 
and demonstrated 4+ MR which was markedly worse from ___.

#Mitral regurgitation:  The patients progressively worsened 
shortness of breath and tachypnea with minimal exertation which 
temporally corellates with the worsening of his mitral 
regurgitation on echo was concerning.  Cardiology was consulted 
and recommended that there is little to do for MR other than 
valve repair/replacement which he is not currently a candidate 
for surgery.
-f/u with Dr. ___ in ___ weeks MV repair vs. observation 

#Supraventricular Tachycardia: Patient with  history of AVNRT in 
the setting of sepsis in the past. After initiating albuterol 
nebulizers the patient triggered for SVT to the 160s and 
hypotensive to the ___.  This episode was thought ___ albuterol 
usage and albuterol was discontinued. His home metoprolol dose 
was increased to 25 mg daily given persistent tachycardia to the 
100-110s.  His SBP actually improved with increased metoprolol 
dosing. 
 
#Hodgkins lymphoma: 17 days post Brentuximab Vedotin therapy 
complicated by C diff colitis.  HE was continued on the 
following PPX therapies: 
- Acyclovir 400 mg PO/NG Q8H 
--Fluconazole 400 mg PO/NG Q24H 
--Sulfameth/Trimethoprim SS 1 TAB PO/NG DAILY 
We defered to the outpatient setting for restarting 
chemotherapy.

#Acute Confusion: Patient was having word finding difficulty on 
___ and ___.  Neuro exam was nonfocal and MRI of the head 
demonstrated likely worsening of ischemic vascular disease and 
sarcoid, but no acute intracranial process or explanation for 
the word finding difficulty.  His symptoms improved after 
discontinuation of cefepimke and flagyl, but he did not feel as 
though his mentation was at its baseline at the time of 
discharge.

#Sarcoidosis:  Prednisone was increased to 20mg daily at 
discharge. The patient appeared to benefit from 2 days of 35 mg 
of prednisone daily on admission. 

#Depression: continued home Fluoxetine

#OSA: on CPAP at home, intermitantly compliant with CPAP  here

Transitional Issues:
-Goals Of care: Patient has had clinically significant poor 
response to chemotherapy complicated by neutropenia and severe 
infection and his prognosis is further guarded by worsening 
mitral regurgitation. He remains full code a the time of 
discharge but this should be readdressed at every visit.

Dear Mr. ___,
It was a pleasure caring for you during your recent admission to 
the ___.  You were admitted with 
diarrhea and found to have an infection of your colon.  Your 
blood counts were low making your more suceptible to infection 
and we treated you with antibiotics.  Your diarrhea improved and 
you complained for worsening shortness of breath, fatigue and a 
fast ___ rate.  We performed an echo imaging test of your 
heart and found that one your heart valves, (the mitral valve) 
is not working well at all and we believe this is the major 
cause of your weakness.  You should follow up with your 
oncologist at the appointments below.  You will be notified by

Transfemoral Extreme Risk MITRAL REGURGITATION
Procedures: TransSEPTAL transcatheter MITRAL valve repair 
Catheter Placement, Mitraclip sheath
right femoral vein Percutaneous mitral Valve
case complexity required a multidisciplinary approach with 
Cardiac Surgery and Interventional Cardiology. Vascular access 
was obtained in the right femoral veinusing vascular ultrasound 
techniques.
RHC and LHC performed by transeptal approach and showed 
significant V waves
Transeptal Puncture was done Using Lamp 45 and needle under 
fluoro and TEE guidance to ensure 4 cm
clearance from annulus Unfractionated heparin was given to 
achieve an ACT> 250 seconds.
A 0.035"" confida wire was advanced through sheath and used to 
advance the Pascal Guide system The
Pascal was advanced through the guide and positioned across A2 
and P2 under fluoro and TEE guidance. First Grab resulted in 
only modest reduction in MR therefore, the leaflets were 
released and
independently grabbed again with reduction in MR to ___, and 
great hemodynamics (no V waves). An additional device was placed 
with resultant 1+ MR and gradient of 2 mmHg The clip were 
released and sheath pulled to RA. No significant shunting seen, 
therefore, sheath removed
after proglide in preclose fashion and applying skin suture 
There was no evidence of complications following the procedure.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for your mitral valve clip procedure. By 
repairing the valve your heart can pump blood more easily and 
your shortness of breath should improve.  
It is very important to take all of your heart healthy 
medications. In particular, you are now taking Aspirin and 
Clopidogrel (Plavix). These medications help to prevent blood 
clots from forming in/around the heart valve. If you stop these 
medications or miss ___ dose, you risk causing a blood clot 
forming on your heart valve. This could cause it to malfunction 
and it may be life threatening. Please do not stop taking 
Aspirin or Plavix without taking to your heart doctor, even if 
another doctor tells you to stop the medications. 
 
You will need prophylactic antibiotics prior to any dental 
procedure. Please obtain a prescription for a one-time dose of 
antibiotics prior to procedures, and inform your dentist about 
your recent cardiac procedure. 
 
Please weigh yourself every day in the morning after you go to 
the bathroom and before you get dressed. If your weight goes up 
by more than 3 lbs in 1 day or more than 5 lbs in 3 days, please 
call your heart doctor or your primary care doctor and alert 
them to this change. Your weight at discharge is 154 pounds. 
 
We have made changes to your medication list, so please make 
sure to take your medications as directed. You will also need to 
have close follow up with your heart doctor and your primary 
care doctor.  

If you were given any prescriptions on discharge, any future 
refills will need to be authorized by your outpatient providers, 
primary care or cardiologist.
 
If you have any urgent questions that are related to your 
recovery from your procedure or are experiencing any symptoms 
that are concerning to you and you think you may need to return 
to the hospital, please call the ___ Heart Line at 
___ to speak to a cardiologist or cardiac nurse 
practitioner.  
It has been a pleasure to have participated in your care and we 
wish you the best with your health.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
=========
___ w/ stage IIIA squamous cell carcinoma of lung, s/p 
completion of concurrent ___ ___, also w/ a h/o 
multiple strokes w/ residual left hemiparesis, HTN, DL, and 
prior colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy who is transferred from 
___ for continuity of care after presenting 
there w/ confusion and worsening LUE weakness. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
============
#Odynophagia/Dysphagia: Most likely radiation esophagitis, 
reflux esophagitis. ___ EGD with esophagitis, gastritis, 
duodenitis. Gastric biopsy showed H. pylori. She was given 
viscous lidocaine with meals, BID PPI, fluids as needed, and a 
regular diet. We had long discussions about her goals of care 
with both her outpatient oncology team as well as her palliative 
care team (detailed below) and it was ultimately decided to not 
pursue full antibiotic therapy for H. pylori as her primary 
symptom of odynophagia is most likely primarily related to 
strictures and radiation esophagitis. 

#Failure to thrive
Seems like most likely etiology is poor po intake. Felt to be 
due to progressive esophagitis (presumably radiation induced). 
She has odynophagia. TSH wnl. No e/o pulmonary infection. UA neg 
at OSH. C diff negative this admission. Geriatrics was involved 
in the patient's care during this admission. Her throat and body 
pain was controlled with IV morphine, and she received viscous 
lidocaine to help her eat/drink more comfortably. She was 
supported with IVF as needed. ___ and OT evaluated her and 
recommended rehab placement however after long discussions of 
her GOC and it was decided that she would not want tube feeding 
and would like to go home on hospice. 

#Nonocclusive thrombus in right IJ
In the setting of being hypercoagulable from malignancy. 
HAS-BLED score is 3 (HTN, stroke Hx, age she is at high risk for 
major bleeding, but is hypercogulable iso malignancy. The 
definitive treatment for her hypercoagulable state is treatment 
of her malignancy, if within GOC. Her home ASA/Plavix were 
continued, and she was started on enoxaparin 80 mg SC daily, 
with the plan to treat for 1 month.

#Stage IIIA Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma
#Bilateral lytic scapular lesions
Most recent imaging, CT chest on ___, revealed substantial 
decrease in size of the pre-existing right hilar mass, which now 
measures 20 x 20 mm in diameter. However CT abd revealed ""new 
1.3 cm hepatic segment VII lesion ... suspicious for 
metastasis."" ___ elevated this admission, consistent with liver 
involvement. Now CT from ___ revealed new bilateral lytic 
scapular lesions.
Outpatient team arranging PET scan in ___, with future 
cancer treatment directed therapies to be determined. Her 
outpatient oncology team (Drs ___ was contacted 
with updates. Hip/femur x-rays were obtained to eval for 
osseous/lytic lesions (because of delays with scheduling a bone 
scan).

#Encephalopathy 
She's been having episodes of confusion for some time now per 
daughter. She locked herself in the bathroom last week. 
""Thetiles have me locked in the bathroom and I can't get out."" 
But the bathroom was not locked. A few weeks ago, she had left 
the stove on during a hot day, and she stated she was heating 
food for her son (who was murdered ___. Daughter is 
concerned
about dementia. MRI brain did not reveal mets or new stroke. 
although pt is oriented x 3, she seems to have poor insight into 
reason for admission and her hospitalization. Confusion possibly 
also due to impaired sleep (sleeps during day, as lives with her 
son who works nights), dehydration, pain from malignancy. 
Geriatrics was consulted and assisted with her care. Her 
nutrition and hydration status were optimized and her pain was 
controlled with IV morphine. She received high dose thiamine for 
possible Wernicke's encephalopathy. She received folic acid 
repletion for severe protein calorie malnutrition.

CHRONIC/RESOLVED ISSUES:
========================
#Worsening LUE and LLE weakness - stable
#History of CVA w/ residual hemiparesis
Likely recrudescence from prior CVA and improved w/ hydration 
and nutrition. Her home aspirin, Plavix, and atorvastatin were 
continued. Her neurologic status was checked daily. She was 
started on Lovenox ___aily.

#Severe protein calorie malnutrition: 
- Nutrition was consulted. She received a regular diet, high 
dose thiamine, folic acid and MVI. Her electrolytes were 
monitored daily and repleted as needed.

#Tobacco Abuse: Continued nicotine patch.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Due to esophageal spasms seen during EGD, outpatient 
esophageal mannometry should be considered to further work up 
her dysphagia/odynophagia.
[] Consider starting a bisphosphonate, if osseous metastases are 
confirmed through bone scan/bone biopsy.

Code status: DNR/DNI

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?
- You were having pain in your throat and body. You were not 
getting enough to eat and drink. Because of this, you were 
weaker than usual, which made your old stroke symptoms seem 
worse. Your children were concerned that you were more confused 
than usual.

WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE HOSPITAL?
- You received scans to make sure that you did not have a new 
stroke.
- You were watched closely for signs of infection.
- You were supported with fluids and nutritious food.
- You underwent an endoscopy procedure, which showed a lot of 
inflammation that is probably causing your swallowing pain. You 
were given liquid lidocaine for throat pain, as well as an acid 
blocker medicine. 
- Your body pain was treated with morphine.

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
- Continue to take all your medicines and keep your 
appointments.

We wish you the best!

Sincerely,

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ h/o stage III splenic flexure colon 
cancer s/p resection, DMII, CAD, HTN who presents from clinic 
with one episode of bright red blood per rectum this morning.  

ACTIVE ISSUES:
 
# Rectal Bleeding: Patient with mild abdominal pain earlier 
today with small amount of blood in stool and on toilet paper. 
It is likely that her abdominal pain could have been gas pain 
given the mild intermittent crampy nature that resolved with 
passing gas. Hemodynamically she was stable, Hct was normal and 
she had no further bleeding. Given she does have hemorrhoids, it 
is most likely that this is the cause of her bleeding, but given 
her history of colorectal cancer, she should have expedited 
outpatient colonoscopy.  She will also be discharged with 
simethicone.

# Abdominal pain/chest pain: Seemed most consistent with gas 
pain given her description and improvement with belching and 
passing flatus. EKG was without evidence of new ischemia. 

# Benign Hypertension: Stable from her baseline. Prescribed 
lisinopril but does not take.

# CAD: On aspirin, statin. 

# Hyperlipidemia: continue rosuvastatin  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- She should have an outpatient colonoscopy
- She may benefit from hemorrhoidal banding (was refered to ___ 
clinic)

 
Medications on Admission:
The Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires 
futher investigation.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
=============
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with stage IIIA squamous cell 
carcinoma of lung undergoing chemoradiation completed on 
___, history of multiple strokes and prior colon cancer s/p 
hemicolectomy who presents with odynophagia x several weeks, 
attributed to radiation esophagitis. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
====================
# Odynophagia/Dysphagia 
#Radiation Esophagitis
Managed with oral liquid lidocaine formulation, which improved 
patient's ability to tolerate PO. Speech and language pathology 
consutled, recommended soft ground diet and thin liquids, which 
was advanced to regular solids. Nutrition consulted as well. If 
symptoms fail to improve with liquid lidocaine and with a time 
course consistent with radiation esophagitis, will need further 
workup as outpatient, such as barium swallow or EGD. Patient was 
started on lansoprazole for any contribution of GERD, should 
continue to assess need for PPI as an outpatient.

# Hypernatremia
Patient with rising Na this admission, up to 149. Likely poor 
oral intake iso radiation esophagitis. Patient received 1L D5W 
with improvement of Na to 141 on day of discharge. She was 
encouraged to maintain liquids throughout the day.

# Severe Malnutrition
Patient with poor PO intake and weight loss. Nutrition was 
consulted, and per their recommendations she received Carnation 
supplements with soy milk with meals, as well as Ensure Clear 
with meals and multivitamins. PO intake was encouraged. SW was 
consulted due to concern about her having adequate resources at 
home (but she denies having issues with resources). ___ assessed 
her and recommended home, where she already has a walker. OOB 
with assistance was encouraged during the admission.

# Vitamin B12 deficiency
B12 was noted to be low this admission, so the patient received 
cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg IM on ___ and was started on PO 
cyanocobalamin daily. MMA was obtained, which was pending at 
time of discharge. CBC was obtained daily.

# Stage IIIA Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma
Undergoing concurrent chemoradiation. Will follow up with Dr. 
___ as outpatient.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
=================
# Hypokalemia, chronic
Hypokalemia has been chronic. Etiology unclear as patient is not 
on diuretics. Other etiologies include kidney dysfunction such 
as rental tubular acidosis. Reportedly does not take potassium 
as often as necessary at home d/t difficulty swallowing pill. 
Urine
electrolytes notable for >20 K which seems inappropriate in 
setting of hypokalemia. Potassium powder was trialed during the 
admission.

# Diarrhea, stable
Patient reports loose stool since radiation. On admission did 
report blood in stool that is streaky and superficial; patient 
denied tarry stools or frank blood. The most concerning etiology 
would be recurrence of colorectal carcinoma (s/p hemicolectomy),
although more likely causes include diverticulosis flare or 
hemorrhoidal bleeding. Cdiff negative. Hb stable throughout this 
admission.

# Tobacco Abuse: Managed inpatient with nicotine patch. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===========================
[] Ensure that patient is eating and drinking without difficulty
[] Continue to assess for presence of blood in stools
[] Should repeat CBC and BMP at next PCP visit to ensure stable 
Hb and Na/K
[] Previously on potassium tablets, but discharged on potassium 
powder given odynophagia, will need to follow up with ability to 
tolerate this.
[] Patient was started on lansoprazole for any contribution of 
GERD, should continue to assess need for PPI as an outpatient.
[] Found to have B12 deficiency anemia during this admission, 
received cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg IM on ___ and was started on 
PO cyanocobalamin daily, which she should continue.
[] Follow up on lab tests that were pending at time of 
discharge: campylobacter stool culture, stool ova + parasites, 
fecal culture r/o Yersinia, methylmalonic acid.
[] Patient was scheduled for outpatient CT chest ___, unable to 
complete as an inpatient, will need to be rescheduled by her 
oncology team
