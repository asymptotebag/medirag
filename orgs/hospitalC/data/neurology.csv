History of Present Illness:
HPI: ___ RHF w/ hx GERD, mild depression, and prior migraines,
presents now with episode of facial numbness. She had been lying
on her left face, watching TV, and noticed when she got up that
her left face was numb as if she were injected with novacaine, 
in
a distribution that she traces along mid-V2 down to her jaw 
line.
She initially thought it was ___ the way she was lying, but
became concerned when it persisted. She endorsed a mild diffuse
dull HA that is not unusual for her. She states in some ways, it
felt as though a migraine were coming on, though the HA she had
was not typical of her past migraines. The numbness lasted 90
minutes, and has now resolved completely. There was no 
associated
weakness, no sensory changes outside of her face, no VC, 
vertigo,
or language impairment. She cannot recall something like this
happening before, and states that her day was otherwise routine.
On ROS, she notes that about 2 weeks ago she had diarrhea for 1
week which resolved spontaneously. She also endorses feeling
""achey"" 4 days ago, otherwise, her health has been normal.

2. Normal cranial and cervical MRA, with no significant mural 
irregularity or 
flow-limiting stenosis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo woman with a hx of depression, GERD and 
migraines, presenting with an episode of facial numbness.

1. Facial numbness.  As this episode preceeded a headache, 
suspect likely due to a migraine equivalent, however episode 
could also be due to a TIA in the thalamus.  The patient had an 
MRI, which showed no signs of ischemia, and normal vasculature, 
making migraine equivalent a much more likely diagnosis.  
However, given the possibility of TIA, she has been started on a 
daily aspirin for future stroke prophylaxis.  Exam on discharge 
was notable for mild symmetric hyperreflexia in the lower 
extremities, but otherwise normal neurological exam, with no 
residual sensory deficits.
 
Medications on Admission:
NEXIUM 40 mg--1 capsule(s) by mouth once a day
PROZAC 20 mg--1 capsule(s) by mouth once a day

 
Discharge Medications:
1. Pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) Sig: One 
(1) Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) PO Q24H (every 24 hours).  
2. Fluoxetine 20 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO DAILY 
(Daily).  
3. Aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) Sig: One (1) 
Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) PO DAILY (Daily).  

 
Discharge Disposition:
Home
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
Migraine 
 
Discharge Condition:
Mild symmetric hyperreflexia in the lower extremities, otherwise 
normal neurological exam.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for left sided facial numbness.  You had an 
MRI which showed no signs of ischemia.  It is suspected that 
this was related to migraine headaches, but we recommend that 
you start taking a full dose of aspirin.

If you notice new numbness, weakness, worsening headaches, or 
other new concerning symptoms, please return to the nearest ED 
for further evaluation.

History of Present Illness:
___ year old right-handed woman with hx of Atrial fibrillation on 
Eliquis (only once daily), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CHF
presents as transfer from OSH after she had acute onset 
dysarthria and CTA showed possible partial thrombus or stenosis 
in superior division of L MCA. Transferred here for closer 
monitoring and possible thrombectomy if her exam acutely 
worsens.

History obtained from patient and daughter at bedside. Patient 
is an excellent historian. 

On ___, she had dinner with friends and then returned to her 
apartment and was fooling around on her computer. Last known 
well
was around 8:00 ___. Then, she had an odd sensation and started 
throwing her arms around. She went to living room to sit down 
and
tried to read but could not see the words very clearly. Then, 
two family members were knocking at the door and she had a tough 
time
standing up to open door. She was able to eventually stand up 
with great difficulty and walked with her walker. She usually 
walks with a walker because of knee replacement. Finally, got up 
out of chair with walker and walked to the door to unlock. She 
noticed problems talking to family members. She had difficulty 
forming words and pronouncing words. Denies word finding 
difficulty. She could tell it was slurred like a person who had 
too much to drink. EMTs asked if she was intoxicated but she was 
not. She was very aware of her dysarthria and told her daughters 
that she thinks she's having a stroke. Then, she said she had 
trouble sitting down but has no idea why she thought that. When 
she was standing, she was able to walk with walker but she felt 
unsteady and almost fell. No visual changes. No numbness or 
tingling. Denies focal weakness; she just had trouble standing 
up. She was able to unlock her door without issue but she felt 
shaky. 

She was brought by EMS to ___ where NIHSS was 1 for 
slurred speech. There, she felt the same but her symptoms 
started to improve when she started to be transferred. 
Paramedics said her speech was improving rapidly en route.  

Last month, started needing naps. Her hearing is poor at 
baseline and she normally uses hearing aids. 

For the past ___ months, she has had ___ nocturia nightly. No 
dysuria. 

She has noticed more frequent headaches lately in the past ___ 
months. Last headache was yesterday. She takes tramadol and 
acetaminophen up to a couple times a night. She reports 
headaches at night which wake her up. She denies that the 
headache is
positional; it is the same sitting up or lying down. She has had 
some gradual weight loss over the past ~12 months; ___ year ago 
she was almost 140 lbs, and now she is ___ lbs. Her appetite is 
still good and she enjoys eating but she is less hungry that she 
used to be.  

Daughter says that she has had marked decline in memory in past 
___ weeks. Over past few years, she has been forgetting plans, 
times for pickpup, and dinner plans, which has become normal. 
Over the past ___ weeks, family has noticed dramatic worsening. 
She doesn't remember which grandkids were coming to visit when 
she bought the plane tickets herself.

She endorses 2 pillow orthopnea.

left ventricular systolic function in the setting of 
beat-to-beat variability due to arrhythmia. Mild to moderate 
mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Normal pulmonary pressure. 
Very small pericardial effusion
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with AFib on Eliquis, CHF, 
HLD, HTN who presented w/ sudden onset dysarthria, abnormal arm 
movements, and poor balance (walker at baseline). NIHSS 1 for 
slurred speech at OSH. There, a CTA head and neck was completed, 
and there was concern for left M2 branch attenuation concerning 
for stenosis or occlusion, and she was subsequently transferred 
for consideration of thrombectomy but NIHSS 0 on arrival so she 
was not deemed a candidate. She was admitted to the Neurology 
stroke service for further evaluation of possible TIA vs stroke. 
No further symptoms noted during admission. MRI head w/o 
contrast were without evidence of stroke. Reports recent 
echocardiogram per outpatient PCP/cardiologist, reported as no 
acute findings and so this was not repeated. She mentioned 
concern about worsening memory, but able to perform ADLs w/ 
meals/cleaning provided by ALF (moved 10 months ago); it appears 
there has been no acute change. She was taking apixiban 2.5mg 
once daily (unclear why as this is a BID medication), and so her 
dose was increased to 2.5mg BID (she was not a candidate for 5mg 
BID due to her age and weight). She was started on atorvastatin 
for her hyperlipidemia (LDL 126). EP cardiology was consulted 
for frequent sinus pauses noted on telemetry that persisted 
despite holding home atenolol, recommending discontinuing home 
digoxin and close cardiology ___. Discharged to home w/ 
___ & ___ and close PCP ___.

#Transient slurred speech and instability, c/f TIA
- ___ consult - cleared for home with home services
- Started on atorvastatin for HLD and increased home apixaban to 
therapeutic level
- ___ with stroke neurology after discharge

Her stroke risk factors include the following:
1) DM: A1c 5.5%
2) Likely chronic segmental left vertebral artery occlusion and 
somewhat small caliber attenuated left M2 inferior branch
3) Hyperlipidemia: LDL 126
4) Obesity
5) No concern noted for sleep apnea - she does not carry the 
diagnosis
An echocardiogram did not show a PFO on bubble study.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of slurred speech due to 
concern for an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a blood 
vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by 
a clot. The brain is the part of your body that controls and 
directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain 
from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety 
of symptoms. However, the MRI of your brain did not show 
evidence of stroke or TIA. Your symptoms could have been related 
to blood pressure, dehydration, alcohol use, or a combination of 
these factors.

We are changing your medications as follows:
Increase apixaban to 2.5mg twice daily
Start Vitamin B12 daily supplement

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please follow up with your primary care physician as listed 
below. You should also follow up with your cardiologist as you 
were noted to have occasional pauses on cardiac monitoring.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, please pay attention to 
the sudden onset and persistence of these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team

NCHCT ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or edema. 
2. Old left pontine infarct corresponds to lesion detected on 
___. 

CXR ___:
CHEST, TWO VIEWS: Lung volumes are low which results in 
bronchovascular 
crowding and extent and accentuates the cardiac silhouette. 
Within this 
limitation, the lungs are clear, without airspace consolidation. 
Hilar 
contours, and pulmonary vasculature are within normal limits. 
Osseous 
structures are intact. Surgical clips within the left upper 
quadrant are 
noted. 
  
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process. 

MRI brain, MRA head/neck ___:

BRAIN MRI: 
  
There is evidence of restricted diffusion seen in the right 
lenticulostriate 
territory extending from the putaminal to the periventricular 
region. Findings 
are indicative of acute infarct. The chronic left pontine 
infarct is 
identified. Several prominent perivascular spaces are seen in 
the basal 
ganglia region. Small right subcortical frontal infarct is also 
identified 
which appears acute given the slow diffusion. Mild changes of 
small vessel 
disease are seen. There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus. 
  
IMPRESSION: Acute right-sided lenticulostriate territory infarct 
involving 
the predominant in the periventricular region. Small acute right 
posterior 
frontal subcortical infarct. Chronic left pontine infarct. Mild 
changes of 
small vessel disease. 
  
MRA OF THE NECK: 
  
Neck MRA demonstrates normal flow in both carotid and right 
vertebral 
arteries. The left vertebral artery is small in size, which 
could be a 
congenital variation. 
  
IMPRESSION: Small left vertebral artery, otherwise unremarkable 
MRA of the 
neck. 
  
MRA OF THE HEAD: 
  
Head MRA is somewhat limited with the motion limiting the 
evaluation at the 
skull base. Otherwise, the MRA is normal in appearance in the 
arteries of 
anterior and posterior circulation. 
  
IMPRESSION: Somewhat limited evaluation of the skull base. 
However, this 
area is well visualized on the neck MRA. Otherwise, MRA of the 
head is 
normal. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This ___ yo woman was admitted with complaints to gait 
instability and slowness of speech as outlined in the HPI. She 
had an otherwise normal neuro exam, but given her history of 
prior stroke and vascular risk factors, she received a brain MRI 
and MRA of the head and neck, which showed 2 small infarcts in 
the right lenticulostriate area and right frontal subcortical 
area. These were thought to be due to a small vessel disease. 
Her MRA was unrevealing.  Her bloodwork revealed elevated 
lipids, for which she was started on Zetia and omega-3 fatty 
acids as she indicated that she could not tolerate lipitor in 
the past because it made her weak. Her HgbA1C was mildly 
elevated to 6.7, and she was counceled that she may have, at the 
least, glucose intolerence. She was instructed to modify her 
diet, be physically active, and follow this up with her PCP. 
Because she became angry when told of the possibilty of 
diabetes, these instructions, along with her med changes, were 
discussed with both her son and daughter. She was also counceled 
to stop smoking, and to be compliant with her medications.  The 
patient will be scheduled for an echicardiogram as an outpatient 
to complete her work-up. 
 
Medications on Admission:
Folate 
Aspirin 325mg daily
Recently stopped simvastatin because it made her gait ""wobbly"" 
no
myalgias.

 
Discharge Medications:
1. Aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).  
2. Folic Acid  Oral
3. Omega-3 Fatty Acids 1,000 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO 
twice a day.
Disp:*60 Capsule(s)* Refills:*2*
4. Zetia 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*

 
Discharge Disposition:
Home
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary diagnosis:
Acute right-sided lenticulostriate territory infarct 
Small acute right posterior frontal subcortical infarct 
Hyperlipidemia

Secondary diagnosis:
History of a left pontine stroke
History of colon cancer 
Cholecystectomy
Diverticulosis
Hemorrhoids

 
Discharge Condition:
Mild difficulty with tandem gait and conjugate superior right 
gaze preference with upgaze only, diminished in legs bilaterally 
and upgoing left toe. 

 
Discharge Instructions:
You have had multiple strokes (a small acute right posterior 
frontal subcortical infarct and an acute right sided 
lenticulostriate territory infract).  These were likely small 
vessel in origin and can be prevented in the future if you 
successfully quit smoking, start a cholesterol lowering 
medication and have a well controlled blood pressure.  You 
should continue to take Aspirin 325mg daily to help prevent 
future strokes.

Please take medications as prescribed.

Please keep your follow-up appointments.

If you have any worsening or worrying symptoms, please contact 
your PCP or return to the ED.

Unchanged, mild to moderate cardiomegaly without a superimposed 
acute 
intrathoracic process. 

___: MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST; MRA 
NECK W/CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. 
2. Multiple punctate foci of slow diffusion with corresponding 
low ADC signal within the right MCA distribution, as described, 
compatible with acute to subacute infarcts. 
3. Brain parenchymal volume loss and presumed sequelae of 
chronic small vessel ischemic disease. 
4. Intracranial vascular irregularity which is typical 
atheromatous disease though no evidence of hemodynamically 
significant stenosis, focal vessel cut off, or aneurysm within 
the intracranial vasculature. 
5. The left vertebral artery is small and its origin is not well 
seen which is felt to likely represent stenosis. 

___: BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with prior paramedian pontine infarct (___) 
and right-sided lenticulostriate territory infarct (___), 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, colon cancer s/p resection and 
chemotherapy in ___, and extensive tobacco use who presents 
with acute onset left sided weakness concerning for stroke. 

#left sided weakness: On the day of admission (___), patient's 
left-sided weakness improved without a history of sensory 
changes or other neurological symptoms.  Her exam on admission 
was notable for left SCM, deltoid, and triceps weakness, as well 
as mild weakness of her left IP and brisker reflexes on the 
left. Patient underwent CT head, which revealed a new 
hypodensity in the right frontal lobe, suggesting for acute and 
subacute infarct, particularly given her extensive history of 
infarcts in the past. Patient also underwent MRI brain and MRA, 
which showed multiple R-sided scattered infarcts that could 
explain her symptoms. Her infarcts seemed embolic. We wondered 
about artery-to-artery due to atherosclerotic ICA disease vs.
cardioembolic source. Of note, patient admitted that she was 
non-compliant with her meds and continues to smoke.
Echo showed LVEF >55% with no masses or thrombi. She was sent 
home with a Holter monitor x 30 days. Because of patient's risk 
factors, she was started on Plavix 75mg. It was discussed with 
patient that she needed to be on high dose statin therapy, and 
atorvastatin 80mg would be recommended, but patient declined 
atorva stating that she had a side effect to another statin 
other than rosuvastatin, and preferred to stay on rosuvastatin. 
I explained that Crestor would not be ideal with current 
guidelines, but based on her preference, she was sent home with 
Crestor 40mg daily. Upon discharge, patient was back to her 
baseline functional level and was symptom-free.  She will 
continue to follow up with Dr. ___ in the clinic.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of acute onset left sided 
weakness that lasted 30mins, resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC 
STROKE, a condition in which a blood vessel providing oxygen and 
nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the 
part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts 
of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its 
blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
hypertension
hyperlipidemia
extensive tobacco use

We are changing your medications as follows:
Plavix 75mg DAILY
Atovarstatin 80mg DAILY

Please take your other medications as prescribed. It is 
important to comply with the prescribed regimen and to STOP 
smoking.
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- sudden weakness of one side of the body
- sudden drooping of one side of the face
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body
- sudden difficulty pronouncing words (slurring of speech)
- sudden blurring or doubling of vision
- sudden onset of vertigo (sensation of your environment 
spinning around you)
- sudden clumsiness of the arm and leg on one side or sudden 
tendency to fall to one side (left or right)
- sudden severe headache accompanied by the inability to stay 
awake

It was a pleasure providing you with care during this 
hospitalization.

___, but 
otherwise appears chronic to possibly subacute, lacunar infarct. 
  Correlate 
with clinical symptoms.  MRI is more sensitive in detecting 
acute ischemia. 
2. Sequelae of prior right frontal lobe infarct and left pontine 
infarct. 
3. Nonspecific bilateral white matter changes are similar the 
prior exam and 
consistent with sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic 
disease. 
4. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. 
5. Cortical atrophy. 

CXR 
IMPRESSION:  
No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Possible minimal 
pulmonary 
vascular congestion.  Stable mild cardiomegaly. 

MRI/MRA brain and neck
IMPRESSION: 
1. Substantially motion limited exam. 
2. Punctate, likely subacute infarcts of the right frontal 
periventricular 
white matter, posterior limb of the right internal capsule or 
right thalamus , 
and right periatrial white matter. 
3. Chronic right frontal cortical infarct is again seen.  
Extensive 
supratentorial white matter signal abnormalities, similar to 
prior, 
nonspecific but likely sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic 
disease in 
this age group. 
4. Nondominant left vertebral artery is diminutive and not 
adequately assessed 
on this motion limited exam.  0 
5. Atherosclerosis of the proximal right internal carotid artery 
is again seen 
but could be exaggerated by artifact.  Apparent irregularity of 
the left 
proximal internal carotid artery, of the V2 and V3 segments of 
the right 
vertebral artery, of the left greater than right carotid 
siphons, and of the 
distal M1 and M2 segments of the left middle cerebral artery 
probably 
represents a combination of atherosclerosis and artifacts. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ RH female with a PMHx of paramedian pontine infarct (___), 
right-sided lenticulostriate territory infarct (___), multiple 
strokes in the right posterior MCA/PCA watershed region (thought 
to be cardioembolic but no source identified, ___ 
Plavix and ASA, HTN, HLD, prior MI, colon cancer s/p resection 
and chemotherapy in ___, extensive tobacco use, recent DM 
diagnosis, and recent diagnosis of B12 deficiency presents with 
4 week hx of progressively worsening left leg weakness and 
falls. On exam she had no signs of neuropathy, intact sensation 
to light touch, temperature and Pin Prick as well as intact 
proprioception. CT Head with right caudate hypodensity of 
indeterminate age, but appears subacute/chronic. MRI/MRA brain 
and neck with punctate, likely subacute infarcts of the right 
frontal periventricular white matter, posterior limb of the 
right internal capsule or right thalamus and right periatrial 
white matter. 
Etiology most likely secondary to known intracranial athero seen 
on imaging vs. small vessel disease. Patient already on 
appropriate secondary stroke prophylaxis and thus no changes to 
her medications were made. She was evaluated by physical therapy 
who recommended home ___.

Chief Complaint:
Gait instability, multiple falls
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr ___ is a pleasant right handed ___ year old male with Afib, 
on coumadin, who is quite independent, living with his wife and 
was in a good state of health until mid last year. At that time 
his wife reports that he began having periods of disorganized 
speech and gait instability. He did not have a fall until 3 
months ago when he broke several ribs on his coffee table. He 
did not have any head trauma and was not scanned at an OSH. His 
garbled speech and unsteadiness have waxed and waned over the 
past 6 months and his wife reports that they are much improved 
when he takes his diuretics. Over this period he has lost ~20 
lbs. 
Last night he was sorting papers at the dining room table when 
he fell from standing because of the dizziness. He reports no 
LOC, no head trauma and was able to stand back up and continue 
his work. His wife placed him on the couch, but he got back up 
and fell in the bathroom - again he denies any LOC or head 
trauma, blaming his instability and ___ weakness. He had no 
tongue biting or loss of bowel/bladder continence. He went to 
bed last night, but the morning of presentation his wife was 
concerned about his falls and brought him to the ED. He does 
have a diagnosis of DM II from just over a month ago and has 
started oral hypoglycemics for which he reports having low ___ at 
home. He was seen by an outside neurologist the week prior who 
had ordered a CT head to be completed the following week. In the 
ED his head was scanned which revealed no bleed but a 3x3 L 
frontal lobe extra-axial mass with compressive effect but
no midline shift. Neurosurgery was contacted for evaluation of 
the mass and its possible role in the patient's recent symptoms.

CT Head ___: 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Extra-axial lesion, containing foci of calcifications 
measuring up to 3 cm, which likely reflects an extra-axial mass 
such as a meningioma. An 
extra-axial hematoma, which would be subacute to chronic, is 
considered less likely. 
2. Loss of gray-white differentiation in the high left 
frontoparietal lobe, could reflect an acute infarct. 

MRI Head ___:
Acute to subacute bilateral infarctions with the largest focus 
in the left post-central gyrus. Appearance of the post-gyrus 
lesion is somewhat 
heterogeneous however and recommend attention on followup 
imaging for further evaluation to exclude the presence of an 
underlying mass. Two meningiomas in the left frontal region 
without significant mass effect.

ECHO ___:
Marked symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity 
size and regional/global systolic function. Mild aortic valve 
stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation. Right ventricular free wall 
hypertrophy. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Dilated 
ascending aorta. 
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
The patient has mild aortic stenosis. Based on ___ ACC/AHA 
Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, a follow-up echocardiogram is 
suggested in ___ years. 
Based on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the 
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical 
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on 
clinical and echocardiographic data. 

MRA Head/Neck ___:
Mild atherosclerotic disease of the basilar artery. There is no 
evidence of acute vascular abnormalities involving the 
intracranial arteries 

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the neurosurgical service on ___ 
from the emergency room after having a series of falls on 
___. A CT of the head demonstrated a left frontal 
extra-axial mass as well as a more acute lesion in the parietal 
lobe on the left. Because of his recent falls, his coumadin was 
held and he was placed on an insulin sliding scale as there was 
some concern for hypoglycemia contributing to the unsteadiness. 

An MRI of this head was obtained which confirmed a meningioma 
overlying the L frontal lobe and a sub-acute infarct in the 
post-central gyrus on the left. While he did have distinct right 
sided weakness in the emergency room, on hospital day #2 this 
weakness had nearly completely resolved and his confusion was 
also better. A neurology consult was obtained given what 
appeared to be a sub-acute stroke on his MRI - they recommended 
restarting the pt's coumadin, holding the dilantin and checking 
an EEG, these were done while he was an inpatient. He also 
underwent a surface echo and an MRA of the brain and neck given 
the likely embolic nature of his strokes. 

Neurology will see him in 3 months with a repeat head MRI. 
___ also saw him for his diabetes managment 
and recommended changing his glipizide to 10 BID, and not 
starting insulin. His sugars were well controlled while in house 
and he did not have any episodes of hypoglycemia. From a 
neurologic standpoing, in-house he did quite well with resultion 
of his right sided weakness although his unsteadiness continued 
and he needed support while ambulating. 

___ recommended he go to a short term rehab until he was better 
able to compete transfers and ambulate with a walker. He will 
follow up with neurology and neurosurgery to discuss how to best 
manage his ischemic strokes and address the meningioma, 
respectively.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Brain lesion
Patient was found to have cerebellar hypodensity on NCHCT from 
OSH. CT w/wo contrast was obtained while in the ED at ___ 
which was concerning for underlying mass lesion and 
hydrocephalus. (Of note, she was unable to get MRI due to 
reportedly having a non-compatible aneurysm clip that was placed 
in ___ at ___. Patient was admitted to the ___ for close 
monitoring and surgical planning. She was started on 
dexamethasone 4mg Q6hr for mass effect. CT torso was obtained 
which showed two lung nodules, see below for more information. 
Neuro and radiation oncology were consulted. Plan was made for 
surgical resection of the lesion. On ___, it was determined 
that her aneurysm clip was MRI compatible and she was able to 
have a MRI Brain for surgical planning. She went to the OR the 
evening of ___ for a suboccipital craniotomy for resection of 
her cerebellar lesion. Postoperatively she was monitored in 
Neuro ICU, where she remained neurologically and hemodynamically 
stable. She was transferred to the ___ on POD#2 and made floor 
status. Her Dexamethasone was ordered to taper down to a 
maintenance dose of 2mg BID over the course of one week. Her 
pathology finalized as small cell lung carcinoma. 

#Lung lesions
CT torso was obtained which showed two lung nodules, one in the 
left paramedian abutting the aortic arch and the other in the 
right upper lobe. Pulmonary was consulted and stated that no 
further intervention was indicated until final pathology was 
back. Heme-Onc was also consulted, and made recommendations that 
no further lung imaging or separate lung biopsy was needed. Both 
Pulmonary and Heme-Onc stated that staging and treatment could 
be determined based on the tissue pathology from resection of 
the brain lesion. Her final pathology came back as small cell 
lung carcinoma. She will follow-up with the thoracic oncologist 
on ___.

activity at your own pace once you are symptom free at rest. 
___ try to do too much all at once.

- No driving while taking any narcotic or sedating medication. 

- If you experienced a seizure while admitted, you are NOT 
allowed to drive by law. 

- No contact sports until cleared by your neurosurgeon. You 
should avoid contact sports for 6 months. 

Medications:

- Please do NOT take any blood thinning medication (Aspirin, 
Ibuprofen, Plavix, Coumadin) until cleared by the neurosurgeon. 
We held your Aspirin 81mg daily. You are cleared to resume this 
medication on POD 14 (___). 

- We held your home Alendronate during this admission. You are 
cleared to resume this medication on POD 14 (___). 

- You may use Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for minor discomfort if 
you are not otherwise restricted from taking this medication.

your face and eyes. This is normal after surgery and most 
noticeable on the second and third day of surgery.  You apply 
ice or a cool or warm washcloth to your eyes to help with the 
swelling. The swelling will be its worse in the morning after 
laying flat from sleeping but decrease when up. 

- You may experience soreness with chewing. This is normal from 
the surgery and will improve with time. Softer foods may be 
easier during this time. 

- Feeling more tired or restlessness is also common.

Imaging:

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ___:
IMPRESSION:  
The lung volumes are low. The patient is intubated, the 
endotracheal tube 
projects approximately 2.6 cm above the carinal. The patient 
also has a 
nasogastric tube, the tip is not visualized on the image. 
Finally, the patient has a right internal jugular vein catheter. 
The course of the catheter is unremarkable, the tip of the 
catheter projects over the upper to mid SVC. 
  
Moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis and, 
potentially, a small left pleural effusion. The patient is ___ 
mild pulmonary edema. ___ addition, there is a rounded opacity at 
the lateral and lower aspect 's of the right hilus, potentially 
representing atelectasis. However, short term radiographic 
followup should be performed to exclude developing pneumonia or 
aspiration. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST ___:
IMPRESSION:  
All of the pulmonary abnormalities could be due to atelectasis 
bilateral lower lobe, including collapse without bronchial 
obstruction.  Lesions ___ the posterior segment of the right 
upper lobe and particularly the lingula should be re-evaluated 
with chest CT, contrast enhanced if clinically feasible, when 
aeration improves elsewhere. Pulmonary hypertension. 
Cardiomegaly. No pulmonary edema or pleural effusion. 

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Comparison across modalities to recent MRI is difficult. 
However, there is no significant change since outside CT of ___. Again there is nonspecific diffuse hypodensity of 
the white matter.  Possible hypodense area 
___ the left cerebellar hemisphere. 
2. Diffuse distribution is somewhat atypical for PRES although 
PRES can be seen ___ a non- posterior distribution. Repeat MRI 
may be helpful for further evaluation. 
3. New aerosolized secretions ___ the sphenoid sinuses, 
opacification of the left mastoid air cells and fluid ___ the 
left middle ear cavity. Please correlate clinically for acute 
sinusitis. 

EEG ___:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study 
because of frequent blunted epileptiform discharges ___ bilateral 
occipital regions. These, only on rare occasions, have a high 
voltage sharp morphology, ___ the bilateral posterior quadrants, 
phase reversing ___ a broad field isoelectric at O1 and O2 or at 
times with shifting laterality between each posterior quadrant. 
At times, these occur ___ brief runs at ___ Hz lasting up to 
five seconds ___ the first half of the recording but do not 
evolve ___ frequency, morphology, or location to meet criteria 
for seizure. ___ the latter half of the recording, the frequency 
of the brief runs decrease to 0.5-0.75 Hz and predominantly have 
only a blunted morphology. These sharp waves indicate 
potentially epileptogenic foci ___ both occipital regions. 
Additionally, there is a continuous pattern of severe diffuse 
background slowing fluctuating with a discontinuous burst 
suppression pattern throughout the entire recording. These 
findings are indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction 
which is non-specific as to etiology. The fluctuations of the 
continuous and discontinuous background pattern could indicate 
either fluctuation ___ severity of the severe diffuse cerebral 
dysfunction or effects of sedating medications. 

EKG ___:
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Prior anteroseptal and 
lateral 
myocardial infarction. Slight ST segment elevation ___ leads 
V1-V2 with 
ST segment depression and T wave inversion ___ leads I and aVL. 
ST segment 
flattening and slight depression ___ leads II and aVF. The ST-T 
wave changes raise the question of active anterolateral ischemic 
process. No previous tracing available for comparison. Clinical 
correlation is suggested.  

TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM ___:
Suboptimal image quality. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No 
thrombus/mass is seen ___ the body of the left atrium. No atrial 
septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color 
Doppler or saline contrast at rest. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). No masses or 
thrombi are seen ___ the left ventricle. There is no ventricular 
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is moderately 
dilated with normal free wall contractility. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully 
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is no aortic 
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is 
seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. 
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid 
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There is 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no 
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.  

MRA MRA BRAIN/NECK W/O CONTRAST ___:
IMPRESSION:  
Study somewhat suboptimal; circle of ___ not completely 
included. 
Allowing for technical limitations, no flow-limiting stenosis or 
aneurysm more than 3mm  of the circle ___ or vessels of the 
neck. Consider repeat evaluation with better quality images when 
feasible. 

___ EEG

IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring 
study because
of occasional blunted epileptiform discharges ___ the bilateral 
posterior
quadrants, phase reversing ___ a broad field isoelectric at O1 
and O2 or at
times with shifting laterality between each posterior quadrant. 
On rare
occasions, these discharges occur ___ brief ___ second runs at 
0.25-0.5 Hz but
do not evolve ___ frequency, morphology, or location to meet 
criteria for
seizure. These blunted epileptiform discharges indicate 
potentially
epileptogenic foci ___ both occipital regions. There is moderate 
to severe
diffuse background slowing, which is nonspecific as to etiology. 
Compared to
the previous days recording, the bilateral posterior quadrant 
epileptiform
discharges have decreased ___ frequency, and there is mild 
improvement ___ the
background.

___ CXR

IMPRESSION: 
 
Examination is centered at the diaphragm, excluding the lung 
apices. Moderate
cardiomegaly is stable, but mild interstitial edema may have 
improved. There
is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion along the 
imaged pleural
surfaces. Left PIC line ends close to the superior cavoatrial 
junction,
repositioned from the azygos vein. Feeding tube has been 
withdrawn to the
upper stomach. The side ports may not all be beyond the 
gastroesophageal
junction.

___ MRI (radiology read)

IMPRESSION: 
 
Several acute small subcortical infarcts are identified since 
the previous MRI
examination. There is been some decrease ___ hyperintensities ___ 
the basal
ganglia, brainstem and cerebellum and cerebral convexity 
regions. Extensive
changes still remain.

___ Renal U/S

days prior to transfer but has been sedated on a propofol drip 
for intubation. On arrival, he had a clear R hemiparesis and 
possible L facial weakness. By the time of extubation and 
transfer to the floor Neurology service from the MICU, these 
symptoms had resolved. His mental status was notable for 
intermittent disorientation to month, year, and location. He had 
multiple anxiety episodes (which reportedly occurred frequently 
prior to admission as well) - these episodes improved with 
olanzapine which wasn't required for the 24 hours prior to 
discharge. He was started on qHS trazodone for insomnia and 
night time agitation. It may be worthwhile to repeat his MRI as 
an outpatient for prognostication purposes, though his exam is 
now clearly improved.

#Respiratory - Patient has been intubated 3x at OSH, each time 
for hypercarbic respiratory failure.  There is also question of 
patient have altered mental status which contributed to 
difficulty weaning from vent and need for intubation for airway 
protection. He was successfully extubated after arrival to the 
FICU on ___.

# CV - Patient with HAs, vision changes, elevated BP and CKD on 
admission to OSH.  Patient was kept on nitro gtt, IV hydral, IV 
metop, clonidine and IV enalapril during hospitalization at ___ 
___.  Initially maintained on nitro gtt. Gradual control of BPs 
(given history of strokes and given likely history of chronic 
HTN) was achieved with SBPs ___ the 120s to 150s with clonidine 
0.3 mg qDay (patch - changed qWk), carvedilol, lisinopril, and 
amlodipine. Clonidine can be weaned by 0.1 mg qWk over the next 
three weeks to off. Further HTN management will be directed by 
the renal service on an outpatient basis.  

# Renal: Patient with elevated creatinine and proteinuria on 
admission to OSH. Seen by nephrology at ___ who gave 
diagnosis of hypertensive nephropathy. Recommended BP control 
and initiation of Ace-inhibitor. Renal U/S at OSH was normal 
except for R renal cyst. Urine sediment reportedly bland. UA 
here unremarkable. Cr remains elevated and stable. Kidney biopsy 
performed ___. Preliminary results revealed endocapillary 
proliferation and some endothelial damage. There is evidence of 
chronic disease, arterial wall thickening, some GN. Most likely 
___ chronic kidney disease. Creatinine 2.6 on ___ creatinine 
2.8 on ___. OSH evaluation for pheo, thyroid abn, cortisol abn 
were unremarkable. Renin and aldosterone pending at the time of 
discharge. Renal dopplers limited by patient cooperation but 
overall unremarkable.

# ID - Patient grew GPCs ___ clusters ___ 2 bottles from cultures 
from ___.  Patient only had PIVs ___ place until ___.  Vanc 
sensitive. TTE without evidence of vegetation. Plan for 
vancomycin; will need two week course starting from date of 
first negative blood culture (last day ___. Also on ___, 
was found to have CXR c/f aspiration PNA. Completed 10 day 
course of IV Zosyn for this.

# Heme: Patient acutely developed an anemia with Hg drop from 
~11 to ___ over 24 hours, but then stable afterwards. Low 
reticulocyte count with elevated ferritin and haptoglobin were 
consistent with anemia of chronic disease. Given history of 
positive guaics (which resolved when the patient was put on a 
PPI), GI was consulted. EGD/Colonoscopy were unremarkable. Any 
further evidence of persistently guiaic positive stools should 
prompt capsule study. Renal felt that chronic renal disease 
could be contributing to anemia but EPO would not be recommended 
for the patient unless his anemia was long standing and until 
his BP was well controlled.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted with a hypertensive urgency with blood 
pressures as high as 240/110. This caused nausea/vomiting and 
headache and damage to your brain called posterior reversible 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PRES) on your Brain MRI. You also 
had multiple small strokes scattered throughout your brain on a 
repeat brain MRI. You initially required intubation for trouble 
breathing. You were transferred to one of our ICUs from another 
hospital for further management after it became difficult to 
extubate you. On admission, you had right sided weakness that 
improved over time. You were ultimately extubated and could 
breath on your own. Your blood pressure required multiple 
medications for management throughout the admission but we 
eventually kept your blood pressure controlled between 
___ on multiple blood pressure medications. You had a 
low red blood cell count (anemia) during the admission which we 
thought was likely because of the stress placed on your body 
(anemia of chronic disease). You had a scope of your upper and 
lower gut to look for other sources of bleeds but these were 
normal. You had a bacterial infection ___ your blood and a 
pneumonia that required treatment with IV Vancomycin and IV 
Zosyn for 12 days. Your kidneys also showed damage from your 
likely long standing high blood pressure. Our renal service 
evaluated you and a kidney biopsy was done to confirm this 
diagnosis. 
You have been evaluated by our physical therapists. They 
recommend discharge home with home physical therapy.
___ addition to the follow up appointments listed below, you will 
also require follow-up with a neurologist. Please obtain a 
referral from your primary care doctor.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old right handed gentleman with no
significant past medical history presenting with a three week
history of bilateral hand paresthesias and weakness, bilateral
leg paresthesias and weakness, bilateral calf pain and a 
resolved
three day episode of R facial droop with ptosis.

Mr. ___ was in his normal state of health until the week of
___ when he fell ill with a cold. He continued to go to
work and only noted a runny nose, congestion, and a cough. He
denies any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea illness, 
difficutly breathing, myalgias, or extreme fatigue. These
symptoms lasted for a week. 

On ___, the pt woke up with tingling in his fingers and
palms. He denies ever having this before and tried all day to
alleviate the sensation without success. This continued for 
three
days and evolved on ___ to include pain and weakness in
his calves, all of which prompted him to call his PCP and go in
for an urgent appointment. He was seen by an NP who found his
temperature to be 99.2. Per report, she felt his symptoms were
suggestive of bilateral Carpel Tunnel Syndrome and sent Lyme
serologies, diabetes screening tests, and thyroid function 
tests.
He was also noted to be hypertensive with a SBP greater than 175
on this visit. 

On follow up with his PCP on ___, he noticed that he 
had
difficulty whistling. His wife also felt his R eyelid was 
droopy,
that he was blinking less than usual, and his smile was
assymetric on the R.  His PCP informed him of the negative Lyme,
diabetes, and thyroid tests, but was concerned for stroke in the
setting of his BP of 182/120 and thus sent him to the ___ in ___. At the ___, he had a negative CT, EKG and
""blood work"". He was diagnosed with Bell's Palsy, informed that
his calf pain was a mystery and given Prednisone. The next day,
he had follow up with an Angels? ___ NP who agreed with 
the
___'s ___ diagnosis and felt that he was having a ""leg 
muscle
problem"". The ___, he felt the pain in his leg had
intensified to a burning sensation, non radiating with increased
weakness, paresthesias, and difficulty walking.  He went back to
the ___ where he was evaluated for DVT with a ""blood test""
and the negative result persuaded them not to do an ultrasound. 
By this time, he felt his facial palsy was completely resolved. 

___, he felt the tingling in his hands had evolved to
""stinging"" pain (___), weakness and numbness with continued
tingling. He felt that he was dropping things all the time and
could not open bottles or button his shirts. His calf pain also
continued and was worsening, thus his PCP gave him an U/s that
was negative and suggested a muscle biopsy, ABI, and EMG.  The
following week, ___, his wife noticed that he appeared 
drunk
when he walked and had to hold on to the wall with each step to
prevent from falling. On ___, he had an ABI and an EMG read
as negative, but while at work, hes legs gave out and he had a
fall complicated by subsequent left hamstring strain. Neurology
follow up was scheduled for ___ and given his history
and progressively worsening symptoms,  he was directly admitted
from clinic to the floor. 
 
On neuro ROS, the pt denies loss of vision, blurred vision,
diplopia, dysphagia, vertigo, or hearing difficulty. Denies
difficulties comprehending speech. No bowel or bladder
incontinence or retention. Denies back pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___ craniotomy for RSX of Cavernous malformation  
 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a very pleasant ___ Caucasian male who was 
diagnosed with a left inferolateral frontal lobe cavernous 
malformation approximately ___ years ago in around ___.  He 
has had an episode where he had twitching of the right side of 
his tongue, some dysarthria and that resulted into more 
extensive simple partial seizures.  Now, this past ___, he 
again had a similar episode where he had twitching of the right 
side of his tongue and he had difficulty speaking.  He is 
currently taking Keppra 1000 mg once a day at night.  

A recent CT shows some hyperdensity within the lesion that is 
indicative of recent hemorrhage.  Given the fact that he has 
continuous seizures despite management of antiepileptic drugs 
and the vicinity of the small cavernoma to the brain surface, we 
think it is reasonable to remove it surgically.  We will set him 
up for surgical resection to a preresection Wand Brain Lab MRI 
prior.  He reviewed the risks and benefits of this operation and 
he is okay with preceding.
