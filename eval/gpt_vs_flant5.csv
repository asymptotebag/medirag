           Please answer in your own words, providing evidence from the relevant notes: Is it more common for patients to present to the emergency department for orthopedic surgery due to a mechanical fall, or due to pain from preexisting health conditions?","Based on the provided clinical notes, it appears that patients are more likely to present to the emergency department for orthopedic surgery due to pain from preexisting health conditions rather than a mechanical fall. 

In the notes for Jesse Robbins, it is mentioned that he experienced pain and weakness in his calves which prompted him to seek medical attention. This suggests that his symptoms were likely related to a preexisting health condition rather than a mechanical fall.

On the other hand, there is no mention of a mechanical fall in any of the other clinical notes provided. The notes for Tracy Thompson and April Barclay both mention symptoms of acute ischemic stroke, which are not typically associated with orthopedic surgery due to a mechanical fall.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is more common for patients to present to the emergency department for orthopedic surgery due to pain from preexisting health conditions rather than a mechanical fall.",<pad> mechanical fall</s>
