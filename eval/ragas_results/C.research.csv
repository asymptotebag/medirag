12,Describe the progression of left-sided weakness for Tracy Thompson.,"Tracy Thompson's left-sided weakness has shown progression over time. Initially, she was noted to have left SCM weakness, mild L pronation with upward drift, and mild left deltoid strength during a clinic visit. She also had brisk reflexes at left biceps and patella, with a mute plantar response bilaterally. She had a broad-based gait with small steps that was safe. 

During a hospital admission, Tracy presented with acute onset left-sided weakness, which improved without sensory changes or other neurological symptoms. Her exam on admission revealed left SCM, deltoid, and triceps weakness, as well as mild weakness of her left IP and brisker reflexes on the left. 

In a subsequent hospital admission, Tracy had progressively worsening left leg weakness and falls over a 4-week period. She had no signs of neuropathy, intact sensation, and intact proprioception. A CT head revealed a new hypodensity in the right frontal lobe, suggesting an acute and subacute infarct, which could explain her symptoms. 

Overall, Tracy's left-sided weakness has evolved from mild weakness in specific muscle groups to more generalized weakness and functional impairment over time, likely due to multiple infarcts and underlying risk factors.","['For patient with name of Tracy Thompson:  Per ED, she was noted to have ___ left hip flexion, 4+ hip extension, 4+ knee extension, upgoing toes on left, left arm.
